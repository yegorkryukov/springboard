       "   'text': 'Agilent Technologies A recently announced its intention to offer a series of senior notes. The interest rate, principal amount, maturity date and other terms of the notes are yet to be determined. The offering is subject to market and other conditions.\\n\\nBofA Securities, Mizuho Securities USA LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for this purpose.

Price and Consensus\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nCash Position\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal second-quarter 2020, Agilent’s cash and short-term investments totaled $1.32 billion compared with $1.23 billion at prior quarter-end. Long-term debt was $1.8 billion, flat sequentially.\\n\\nDuring the recently reported quarter, operating cash flow was $313 million. Agilent paid $55 million in dividends and repurchased 1.66 million shares for $126 million.\\n\\nIn our view, the stock offering is expected to boost financial flexibility and help the company meet financial obligations in an efficient way. Moreover, it provides ample scope to deploy capital for long-term growth opportunities and rewarding higher returns to stockholders.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAgilent’s expanding product portfolio, end-market strength and robust performance in key markets are growth drivers. Moreover, the company’s decision to divest/wind up underperforming businesses is beneficial for core operations.\\n\\nRecently, Agilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to drive top-line growth. Also, growth of the API business is a catalyst.\\n\\nIts focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative high-margin product launches is another positive.\\n\\nHowever, increasing competition and higher expenses are making margin expansion difficult for the company.\\n\\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\\n\\nAgilent currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Wayfair Inc. W, eBay EBAY and Inphi Corporation IPHI. While Wayfair sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both eBay and Inphi carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NYSE: A) today announced two new mass spectrometry (MS) products: the Agilent 6470B Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (6470 LC/TQ) system, and the Agilent RapidFire 400 system. Both deliver even faster detection of target compounds providing customers increased sample throughput and reduced time to generate results. The instruments are being introduced at ASMS 2020 Reboot, the interactive, online version of the annual conference of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, being held June 1-12, 2020.\\n\\n\"Agilent continues to strive to meet the evolving needs of our mass spec customers, and address the challenges they face daily,\" said Monty Benefiel, vice president, and general manager of Agilent\\'s Mass Spectrometry Division. \"These new products offer customers workflow solutions that maximize sample throughput and stability, as well as greater reliability than ever before.\"\\n\\nThe 6470B system includes enhancements that boost system uptime and improve overall system performance for low-level detection in routine, high-throughput environments. Customers running a single chromatographic method for applications such as multi-residue screening will see greater data fidelity, reproducibility, and sensitivity. The system integrates seamlessly into existing analytical labs and customer workflows—and it offers quicker routine maintenance through the addition of VacShield technology, designed to easily remove ion injectors without venting.\\n\\nThe high-throughput RapidFire 400 integrated autosampler provides fast results with cycle times as short as 2 sec/sample and adds optional sample cooling for greater sample stability. The system includes barcode reading capabilities for sample tracking, now supports 1,536 well plates, and allows unattended operation for the analysis of more than 98,000 samples. It is further designed to integrate with the Ultivo LC/TQ system, further reducing lab space requirements.\\n\\nAbout Agilent Technologies\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, +0.65% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +3.00% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, +2.31% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +8.36% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis. On the upside, people still value homeownership now, said Ackman.\\n\\nThe chart\\n\\nThis Goldman Sachs chart shows the recovering, but bumpy trajectory for China consumer activity — includes hotels, movie, theater, retail sales, airline seat miles — post pandemic, versus the U.S., where it is obviously deeply depressed.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing.

The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co. F, +4.91% plant that has switched production to make ventilators and masks. Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic. They have been regularly touted by President Donald Trump, who said this week that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine.

A, +0.22% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +7.02% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +3.57% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.49% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, +1.34% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc.

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our \"building and buying\" strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $1.20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.95 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

       "   'text': \"Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio), the leader of Pershing Square Capital Management, released his first-quarter portfolio last week.\\n\\nThe guru's New York-based hedge fund is known for taking large positions in a handful of underperforming companies and pushing for change in order to unlock value for shareholders. One of Ackman's most well-known activist targets in recent years, which did not end well for him, was Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAckman's most notable trades for the three months ended March 31 included new positions in Blackstone Group Inc. (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK), as well as significant increases in his holdings of Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) and The Howard Hughes Corp. (NYSE:HHC). He also curbed his stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG) by 32.66%.\\n\\nBlackstone Group\\n\\nThe activist guru invested in 548,526 shares of Blackstone, allocating 0.38% of the equity portfolio to the position.

As a result of issuing approximately $8.3 billion in new long-term debt over the past three years, it has poor interest coverage.\\n\\nThe company's profitability did not fare much better, scoring a 4 out of 10 rating on the back of a net margin and return on equity that outperform slightly over half of its competitors. Despite recording a slowdown in revenue per share growth over the past 12 months, Blackstone also has a business predictability rank of one out of five stars. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return, on average, 1.1% per annum over a 10-year period.\\n\\nOf the gurus invested in Blackstone, Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) has the largest position with 0.10% of its outstanding shares.

       "   'text': 'After several years of lackluster returns, Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio) is having a blowout 2020. This comes off the back of a fantastic year in 2019 as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to its December update, Ackman\\'s hedge fund, Pershing Square Holdings, gained 4.5% in December, bringing its 2019 net performance to 58.1%.\\n\\nAckman\\'s run of good luck has continued into 2020. As of the beginning of this month, Pershing Square was up more than 17%. That\\'s compared to a double-digit decline for the S&P 500 over the same period.\\n\\nBig payoff\\n\\nAckman hit the headlines back in March when it was revealed that he\\'d made a 100-fold return on a hedging bet.\\n\\nPershing Square bought far out of the money protection against investment-grade and high-yield bond indexes, spending about $27 million for this protection. Ackman and his team bet that if volatility exploded, credit spreads would widen dramatically, putting what has been described as their \"ultra-convex bets\" in the money and generating a huge payoff.\\n\\nThat\\'s just what happened. Ackman reportedly booked a $2.6 billion gain on the trade when volatility spiked in March.\\n\\nThis gave the hedge fund manager a considerable war chest to invest in the market when stock prices for many companies had reached multi-year lows. Ackman used this cash to increase holdings in some of his favorite positions while buying new stakes in others.\\n\\nAckman\\'s buys\\n\\nAccording to Pershing Square\\'s latest 13F filing, the activist hedge fund manager nearly doubled his position in home improvement retailer Lowe\\'s Cos (NYSE:LOW) during the first quarter. The position now accounts for 16% of his portfolio and was worth just over $1 billion at the end of March.\\n\\nAckman first invested in Lowe\\'s back in 2018. Writing in his 2018 annual shareholder letter, the activist investor said that he was attracted to the company due to its ambitions to increase profit margins to 12% over the medium-term from 9.2%. The company aims to improve operations to a similar caliber as that of peer Home Depot (NYSE:HD), which has margins of nearly 15%.\\n\\nAckman also used his windfall to increase Pershing Square\\'s stake in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B). Commenting on the position in 2019, the hedge fund manager said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The catalyst for our current investment in Berkshire is our view that the company is currently trading at one of the widest discounts to its intrinsic value in many years, at a time when we expect the operating performance of its subsidiaries to improve as a result of certain managerial and organizational changes at the company.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the stock has only continued to fall in 2020, it seems reasonable to speculate that Ackman believes the company is substantially more undervalued today than it was last year.\\n\\nAckman also substantially increased his position in Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A). The fund increased the holding by nearly 300% to just over 12.6 million shares. It now has a 14% portfolio weight.\\n\\nHe also increased his position in Howard Hughes Corp (NYSE:HHC) by 455%. The position is now 12.2 million shares, worth just over $616 million.\\n\\nTwo additions to the portfolio in the quarter were The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK). These are currently quite small positions in the portfolio. They make up just 0.4% and 0.8% of the equity portfolio, respectively. It\\'ll be interesting to see if the hedge fund manager continues to acquire shares in these companies over the next few months. He traditionally owns a concentrated portfolio of investments, with an average portfolio weight of 10%.\\n\\nDisclosure: The author owns shares in Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\nRead more here:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies A is set to report fiscal second-quarter 2020 results on May 21. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered in-line results.\\n\\nThe stock outperformed earnings estimates twice, matched once and missed on another occasion in the last four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 1.9%.\\n\\nTrend in Estimate Revision\\n\\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has declined 7.9% to 58 cents per share over the past 30 days. This indicates a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying a decline of 4.97% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business. Also, growth of the API business should have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative product launches is expected to have aided its performance.\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Agilent this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

       "   'text': 'In this article you are going to find out whether hedge funds think Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It\\'s not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) was in 35 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of March. A investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest in recent months. There were 46 hedge funds in our database with A positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that A isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds\\' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 51 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren\\'t comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.\\n\\n[caption id=\"attachment_607931\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"] Bill Ackman of Pershing Square[/caption]\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, 2020\\'s unprecedented market conditions provide us with the highest number of trading opportunities in a decade. So we are checking out trades like this one. We interview hedge fund managers and ask them about their best ideas. If you want to find out the best healthcare stock to buy right now, you can watch our latest hedge fund manager interview here. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when the S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Now let\\'s view the latest hedge fund action encompassing Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A).\\n\\nHedge fund activity in Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A)\\n\\nAt Q1\\'s end, a total of 35 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -24% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 41 hedge funds with a bullish position in A a year ago. With the smart money\\'s positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a select group of notable hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes significantly (or already accumulated large positions).\\n\\nIs A A Good Stock To Buy?

The offering is subject to market and other conditions.\\n\\nBofA Securities, Mizuho Securities USA LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for this purpose.

Price and Consensus\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nCash Position\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal second-quarter 2020, Agilent’s cash and short-term investments totaled $1.32 billion compared with $1.23 billion at prior quarter-end. Long-term debt was $1.8 billion, flat sequentially.\\n\\nDuring the recently reported quarter, operating cash flow was $313 million. Agilent paid $55 million in dividends and repurchased 1.66 million shares for $126 million.\\n\\nIn our view, the stock offering is expected to boost financial flexibility and help the company meet financial obligations in an efficient way. Moreover, it provides ample scope to deploy capital for long-term growth opportunities and rewarding higher returns to stockholders.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAgilent’s expanding product portfolio, end-market strength and robust performance in key markets are growth drivers. Moreover, the company’s decision to divest/wind up underperforming businesses is beneficial for core operations.\\n\\nRecently, Agilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to drive top-line growth. Also, growth of the API business is a catalyst.\\n\\nIts focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative high-margin product launches is another positive.\\n\\nHowever, increasing competition and higher expenses are making margin expansion difficult for the company.\\n\\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\\n\\nAgilent currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Wayfair Inc. W, eBay EBAY and Inphi Corporation IPHI.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

Hilton HLT, +3.00% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, +2.31% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +8.36% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing. Americans are expected to move more freely over the coming long Memorial Day holiday weekend that signals the start of summer.\\n\\nRead now: States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: More beaches, casinos open ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend\\n\\nIt also comes as an ABC News/Ispos poll found that just 39% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, the lowest reading for the president since the poll started to track sentiment in March.\\n\\nA Fox News poll published on Thursday found just 44% of those polled approve of Trump’s performance, down from 49% in April. The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co. F, +4.91% plant that has switched production to make ventilators and masks. Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic. They have been regularly touted by President Donald Trump, who said this week that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine. A number of clinical trials are underway evaluating the medications as both a treatment or a prophylactic for those at high-risk of contracting the virus.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThere are now 5.24 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and at least 338,762 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.

A, +0.22% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +7.02% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +3.57% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.49% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, +1.34% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +9.27% UAA, +9.45% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our \"building and buying\" strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.58 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 22.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this scientific instrument maker would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering no surprise.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\\n\\nAgilent, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.24 billion for the quarter ended April 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nAgilent shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -8%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Agilent?\\n\\nWhile Agilent has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $1.20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.95 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "   'text': \"Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio), the leader of Pershing Square Capital Management, released his first-quarter portfolio last week.\\n\\nThe guru's New York-based hedge fund is known for taking large positions in a handful of underperforming companies and pushing for change in order to unlock value for shareholders. One of Ackman's most well-known activist targets in recent years, which did not end well for him, was Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAckman's most notable trades for the three months ended March 31 included new positions in Blackstone Group Inc. (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK), as well as significant increases in his holdings of Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) and The Howard Hughes Corp. (NYSE:HHC). He also curbed his stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG) by 32.66%.\\n\\nBlackstone Group\\n\\nThe activist guru invested in 548,526 shares of Blackstone, allocating 0.38% of the equity portfolio to the position. The stock traded for an average price of $55.53 per share during the quarter.\\n\\nThe New York-based investment management company has a $63.18 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $52.86 on Wednesday with a price-earnings ratio of 72.41, a price-book ratio of 6.64 and a price-sales ratio of 19.24.\\n\\nThe Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overpriced. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 1 out of 10 also supports overvaluation since the price-earnings and price-sales ratios are near multiyear highs.\\n\\nf36bfbf8c4cc9efe5a3cf125c5531bbe.png More\\n\\nGuruFocus rated Blackstone's financial strength 3 out of 10. As a result of issuing approximately $8.3 billion in new long-term debt over the past three years, it has poor interest coverage.\\n\\nThe company's profitability did not fare much better, scoring a 4 out of 10 rating on the back of a net margin and return on equity that outperform slightly over half of its competitors. Despite recording a slowdown in revenue per share growth over the past 12 months, Blackstone also has a business predictability rank of one out of five stars. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return, on average, 1.1% per annum over a 10-year period.\\n\\nOf the gurus invested in Blackstone, Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) has the largest position with 0.10% of its outstanding shares. Other top guru shareholders include Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio), Julian Robertson (Trades, Portfolio), Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio), John Rogers (Trades, Portfolio), Alan Fournier (Trades, Portfolio), Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio), Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, David Rolfe (Trades, Portfolio), Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and Mairs and Power (Trades, Portfolio).\\n\\nPark Hotels & Resorts\\n\\nAckman picked up 677,888 shares of Park Hotels & Resorts, dedicating 0.08% of the equity portfolio to the holding. Shares traded for an average price of $19.07 each during the quarter.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Tysons, Virginia, the real estate investment trust, which focuses on hotel properties, has a market cap of $2.14 billion; its shares were trading around $9.08 on Wednesday with a price-book ratio of 0.39 and a price-sales ratio of 0.73.\\n\\nAccording to the price chart, the stock is trading above its median price-sales value but below its median price-book ratio.\\n\\ne6e60d50115482e0a1a4eab922ceec3c.png More\\n\\nPark's financial strength was rated 4 out of 10 on the back of low interest coverage and an Altman Z-Score of 0.66, which warns the company could be in danger of going bankrupt. The weighted average cost of capital also exceeds the return on invested capital, suggesting poor profitability.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

       "   'text': 'After several years of lackluster returns, Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio) is having a blowout 2020. This comes off the back of a fantastic year in 2019 as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to its December update, Ackman\\'s hedge fund, Pershing Square Holdings, gained 4.5% in December, bringing its 2019 net performance to 58.1%.\\n\\nAckman\\'s run of good luck has continued into 2020. As of the beginning of this month, Pershing Square was up more than 17%. That\\'s compared to a double-digit decline for the S&P 500 over the same period.\\n\\nBig payoff\\n\\nAckman hit the headlines back in March when it was revealed that he\\'d made a 100-fold return on a hedging bet.\\n\\nPershing Square bought far out of the money protection against investment-grade and high-yield bond indexes, spending about $27 million for this protection. Ackman and his team bet that if volatility exploded, credit spreads would widen dramatically, putting what has been described as their \"ultra-convex bets\" in the money and generating a huge payoff.\\n\\nThat\\'s just what happened. Ackman reportedly booked a $2.6 billion gain on the trade when volatility spiked in March.\\n\\nThis gave the hedge fund manager a considerable war chest to invest in the market when stock prices for many companies had reached multi-year lows. Ackman used this cash to increase holdings in some of his favorite positions while buying new stakes in others.\\n\\nAckman\\'s buys\\n\\nAccording to Pershing Square\\'s latest 13F filing, the activist hedge fund manager nearly doubled his position in home improvement retailer Lowe\\'s Cos (NYSE:LOW) during the first quarter. The position now accounts for 16% of his portfolio and was worth just over $1 billion at the end of March.\\n\\nAckman first invested in Lowe\\'s back in 2018. Writing in his 2018 annual shareholder letter, the activist investor said that he was attracted to the company due to its ambitions to increase profit margins to 12% over the medium-term from 9.2%. The company aims to improve operations to a similar caliber as that of peer Home Depot (NYSE:HD), which has margins of nearly 15%.\\n\\nAckman also used his windfall to increase Pershing Square\\'s stake in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B). Commenting on the position in 2019, the hedge fund manager said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The catalyst for our current investment in Berkshire is our view that the company is currently trading at one of the widest discounts to its intrinsic value in many years, at a time when we expect the operating performance of its subsidiaries to improve as a result of certain managerial and organizational changes at the company.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the stock has only continued to fall in 2020, it seems reasonable to speculate that Ackman believes the company is substantially more undervalued today than it was last year.\\n\\nAckman also substantially increased his position in Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A). The fund increased the holding by nearly 300% to just over 12.6 million shares. It now has a 14% portfolio weight.\\n\\nHe also increased his position in Howard Hughes Corp (NYSE:HHC) by 455%. The position is now 12.2 million shares, worth just over $616 million.\\n\\nTwo additions to the portfolio in the quarter were The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK). These are currently quite small positions in the portfolio. They make up just 0.4% and 0.8% of the equity portfolio, respectively. It\\'ll be interesting to see if the hedge fund manager continues to acquire shares in these companies over the next few months. He traditionally owns a concentrated portfolio of investments, with an average portfolio weight of 10%.\\n\\nDisclosure: The author owns shares in Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\nRead more here:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

This indicates a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying a decline of 4.97% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business. Also, growth of the API business should have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative product launches is expected to have aided its performance.\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Agilent this time around.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nAmazon. com has successfully invaded many different businesses—but Covid-19 testing? The company said during its recent earnings call that it expects to spend $4 billion or more in the second quarter responding to the pandemic. Among other things, it is spending “hundreds of millions to develop our own Covid-19 testing capabilities.”\\n\\nThis news has Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wondering if Amazon might evolve into a major Covid-19 testing player. “We believe the goal is to create Covid-19 testing stations that Amazon employees can pass through on a daily basis,” Nowak writes in a note. “Amazon expects to spend $1 billion on this initiative between April and the end of 2020.”\\n\\nNowak believes Amazon will work on a rapid saliva test. He’s upbeat, despite many unmet promises around testing and Amazon’s lack of experience. He ticks off three challenges, which, he says, play to its strengths. One is supply chain. “The tests will need to be produced in massive quantities and manufacturing capacity built quickly,” he writes. The second is optimization of a test likely to struggle with efficiency and accuracy. The third is capital; Amazon is flush.\\n\\nWhy would Amazon want to get into testing? Nowak, who has an Overweight rating and a $2,600 target price for the stock, argues that employee and customer safety could become a competitive edge in e-commerce. “The potential public goodwill created through [sharing] this cannot be valued, and in a world where tech regulation is a recurring topic, could be a game changer,” he writes.\\n\\nAmazon itself is playing things down. “We’re not sure how far we will get in the relevant time frame, but we think it’s worth trying,” Amazon said.\\n\\nThis Week\\n\\nMonday 5/18\\n\\nThe World Health Organization holds its 73rd World Health Assembly.

       "   'title': 'Earnings Preview: Agilent Technologies (A) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline',\n",
       "   'text': \"The market expects Agilent Technologies (A) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2020. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 21, 2020, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.3%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $1.18 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent?\\n\\nFor Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -18.88%.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

The president has tweeted support for protesters in states including Michigan against restrictions on movement.\\n\\nDemocrats had criticized the plan to wind down the task force, given the U.S. is still seeing increases in case numbers and deaths. Trump acknowledged that reopening would possibly result in more deaths but said, “we can’t sit in the house for the next three years.”\\n\\nA group of young volunteers recruited by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner that was tasked with securing personal protective equipment, or PPE, for frontline workers were told to prioritize tips from political allies and associates of the president, the New York Times reported.\\n\\nCiting emails and documents obtained by their reporters, the paper said few of the leads actually panned out and the volunteers, who had no experience in procurement, were confused and overwhelmed by the task. PPE has been in short supply across the U.S. since the start of the outbreak and is reported to have contributed to infections among health-care and other medical workers.\\n\\nRead: Your genes could determine whether coronavirus puts you in the hospital — and we’re starting to unravel which ones matter\\n\\nIn the U.K., a scientist and top government adviser on the pandemic resigned after he was caught breaking lockdown rules. Prof. Neil Ferguson quit the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment,” as the Guardian reported. The move came after a Daily Telegraph report revealed that Ferguson’s lover had crossed London to visit him at least twice after lockdown measures were implemented.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThe U.K.’s case tally crossed 200,000 on Wednesday and it now has the highest death toll in Europe, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K. has 202,355 cases and 30,150 deaths, putting its death toll ahead of Italy’s, which was an early hot spot. Official numbers from the U.K. have a slightly different tally.\\n\\nThere are 3.71 million cases of COVID-19 globally and 259,695 people have died. At least 1.2 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case toll at 1.21 million and the highest death toll at 71,463.\\n\\nSpain has the highest number of cases in Europe at 219,329 and 25,613 deaths.

A, +0.22% has started to reopen stores that were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic in those locations where regulations allow it. “We are optimistic for the future and we’re happy to announce that we have begun to open select stores globally on a rolling basis and will continue to do so in the weeks ahead,” Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said in a regulatory filing. “We will open stores as State and local regulations allow and as we are able to meet the applicable safety and health standards.”\\n\\n• Bunge Ltd. BG, +3.81% reported a surprise first-quarter loss, revenue that fell below expectations and provided a downbeat full-year outlook, saying that while it didn’t experience a significant disruption to its business from the pandemic, it did start to see the negative impact of a change in consumer behavior in its edible oils business in March. “Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,” said Chief Executive Greg Heckman. The company said it expects 2020 EPS to be lower than its original expectation.\\n\\n• CVS Health Corp. CVS, +0.01% reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, as its pharmacy and retail business got a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pharmacy businesses benefited from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19-related lockdowns. CVS affirmed its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is above the current FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• General Motors reported first-quarter profit and revenue that fell, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to suspended operations, but beat expectations as U.S. truck sales rose sharply. GM’s U.S. sales fell 7%, driven by the negative effects of the pandemic, but sales of full-size pickups rose 27%, with market share increasing to 41%. Among actions GM has taken to preserve cash during the pandemic include suspension of its dividend and share repurchases, salary cuts and drawing on its credit facilities.\\n\\n• Office Depot Inc. ODP, +4.31% posted first-quarter earnings that blew past estimates. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Office Depot had liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end, its highest net cash position in two years. “Our B2B focus is helping businesses remain operational in the home or at the office, our facilities have largely remained open serving customers with enhanced sanitation and safety protocols, and our e-commerce platform and retail stores are proving to be trusted means for customers to access the critical products and services they need,” Chief Executive Gerry Smith said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 2% in the quarter and e-commerce sales saw a strong jump in demand, he said. The company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance given the uncertainty around the pandemic and is suspending temporarily its share buybacks and dividend payments. Separately, it announced that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to block any party from taking advantage of a falling share price to build a stake in the company.\\n\\n• Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. SPR, +21.34% swung to a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter on revenue that fell less than forecast. The suspension of Boeing Co’s BA, +12.94% production of the 737 MAX plane led to lower margins as given “abnormal” costs associated with the pandemic. Actions the company has taken to preserve liquidity and cut costs amid the 737 MAX groundings and the COVID-19 pandemic include cutting the dividend, suspending share buybacks, deferring repayments of an advance from Boeing and cutting jobs and work schedules. The company will not provide 2020 financial guidance given the continued uncertainties surrounding the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic.\\n\\n• United Airlines Inc. UAL, +12.50% is offering $2.25 billion in senior secured notes in a private offering. The bonds will be offered in two tranches maturing in 2023 and 2025. Proceeds of the deal will be used to repay a $2.0 billion term loan entered into in March and for general corporate purposes. Airlines have been tapping credit lines and government relief plans with most fleets grounded during the pandemic.\\n\\n• Wendy’s Co. WEN, +1.09% reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. Wendy’s had a cash balance of $365 million as of May 3 after fully drawing down its revolving financing facility, reducing its second-quarter dividend and taking other measures due to the pandemic. Nearly all (96%) of Wendy’s restaurants are operating, including 99% in the U.S., with drive-through and delivery only. Wendy’s has said that disruptions to the beef supply chain has put limits on the availability of certain menu items.',\n",

       "   'title': \"Agilent Technologies, Inc. -- Moody's assigns P-2 rating to Agilent's new commercial paper program, affirms Baa2 rating, outlook stable\",\n",
       "   'text': 'NOTE: On May 05, 2020, the press release was corrected as follows: In the debt list, for Agilent Technologies, Inc., under “Outlook action” was changed to “Maintained, Stable.” Revised release follows.\\n\\nNew York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody\\'s Investors Service, (\"Moody\\'s) assigned a P-2 short term rating to Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\'s (\"Agilent\") new $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Concurrently, Moody\\'s affirmed the Baa2 senior unsecured rating. The outlook is stable.\\n\\nThe new $1.0 billion program is supported by Agilent\\'s $1.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring March 2024. Moody\\'s anticipates that Agilent will not issue more under its CP program than is available under its revolving credit facility at any given time, to maintain full back-stop under the program. The credit agreement has no material adverse change clause or material adverse event language related to litigation that would restrict borrowings. The revolver has same-day availability for US borrowings.\\n\\nThe P-2 rating reflects Agilent\\'s excellent liquidity, the company had $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash at January 31, 2020, offset by approximately $675 million of short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt. Agilent has full availability under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The revolver contains financial maintenance covenants. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is currently set at 3.5x, and Moody\\'s expects the company will maintain ample cushion under the leverage covenant.\\n\\nThe rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, the deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The life science tools and services sector has been one of the sectors adversely affected by the shock.\\n\\nMore specifically, Agilent will be impacted by the temporary closure of some research labs, deferral of customers\\' spending on expensive capital equipment and reduced demand from certain economically sensitive industrial and applied end-markets. Further, reduced physician visits and the deferral of healthcare services will also negatively impact demand for certain clinical diagnostics products. Moody\\'s regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, the affirmation of the Baa2 rating reflects Moody\\'s views that Agilent is well positioned at the current Baa2 rating. This reflects the company\\'s strong market positions, diversification both in terms of geographies and end-markets, and conservative financial policies -- as evidenced by leverage that is modest for the Baa2 rating. Further, Agilent has taken steps to adjust its cost base and manage cash conservatively, which includes the suspension of its share buyback program.\\n\\nMoody\\'s took the following rating actions for Agilent Technologies Inc.:\\n\\nAssignments:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\n....Commercial Paper, Assigned P-2\\n\\nRatings affirmed:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nSenior unsecured, at Baa2\\n\\nOutlook action:\\n\\nMaintained, Stable\\n\\nRATINGS RATIONALE\\n\\nThe Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating reflects Agilent\\'s favorable scale, strong competitive positions, attractive growth prospects across key markets, good customer and geographic diversification, moderate leverage, and excellent liquidity. Agilent\\'s ratings also reflect Moody\\'s expectations that the company will maintain conservative financial policies with debt/EBITDA approaching 2.0x in the next 12-18 months. The company\\'s rating is constrained by a relatively high reliance on revenue generated from the sale of expensive equipment used in analytical laboratories. This increases Agilent\\'s sensitivity to economic cycles.\\n\\nReflecting the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the lost business days by the customers of life science companies such as Agilent will temporarily reduce the demand for certain consumable products. Further, some equipment purchases will be delayed. The company\\'s operations, products and services are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for handling, storing and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. An inability to adhere to such standards could result in financial penalties and remediation costs. However, the company applies strict standards for the protection of the environment and occupational health, and high safety standards that help mitigate this risk. Agilent maintains a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. In terms of governance, the company has a track record of maintaining low financial leverage and ample liquidity.\\n\\nThe stable outlook reflects Moody\\'s view that Agilent will maintain its strong market leadership, remain well diversified, and maintain conservative financial policies.\\n\\nFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS\\n\\nRatings could be upgraded if the company is able to generate higher levels of recurring revenue relative to total sales and further strengthens operating performance. Quantitatively, ratings could be upgraded if debt/EBITDA was sustained below 2.0 times.\\n\\nRatings could be downgraded in the event of significant market share erosion, or severe contraction in its key markets. Ratings could also be downgraded in the event of a large debt financed acquisition or shareholder distribution. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if debt to EBITDA was sustained above 3.0 times.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (\"Agilent\") is a leading manufacturer of laboratory equipment and products used in clinical diagnostics. Key product platforms include liquid and gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers, which have applications in a variety of end markets including healthcare, food, chemical and environmental industries. Agilent reports three business segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (\"LSAG\"), Diagnostics and Genomics (\"DGG\") and Agilent CrossLab Group (\"ACG\"). The Life Science and Applied Markets segment sells instruments and software that identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. DGG sells products that help customers obtain data from cellular and molecular samples. ACG sells chemistries, supplies, services and software that help to improve productivity inside its customers\\' labs. The company generates annual revenue of $5.2 billion.\\n\\nThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Medical Product and Device Industry published in June 2017 and available at https://www.moodys.com/research/Medical-Product-and-Device-Industry--PBC_1071635.

       "   'title': \"Did Agilent Technologies' (NYSE:A) Share Price Deserve to Gain 80%?\",\n",
       "   'text': \"When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) share price is up 80% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (ignoring dividends).\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies\\n\\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\\n\\nOver half a decade, Agilent Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 32% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\\n\\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\\n\\nNYSE:A Past and Future Earnings May 1st 2020 More\\n\\nThis free interactive report on Agilent Technologies's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\\n\\nWhat About Dividends?\\n\\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Agilent Technologies, it has a TSR of 89% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nInvestors in Agilent Technologies had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.4% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 1.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Agilent Technologies that you should be aware of.\\n\\nOf course Agilent Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.\\n\\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.\\n\\nIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.

       "   'text': 'In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) by estimating the company\\'s future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. I will be using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don\\'t get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\\n\\nWe generally believe that a company\\'s value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies\\n\\nCrunching the numbers\\n\\nWe\\'re using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company\\'s growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\\n\\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today\\'s value:\\n\\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\\n\\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$682.2m US$1.12b US$1.29b US$1.30b US$1.32b US$1.34b US$1.36b US$1.39b US$1.41b US$1.43b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x5 Analyst x7 Analyst x5 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.45% Est @ 1.53% Est @ 1.6% Est @ 1.64% Est @ 1.67% Est @ 1.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$634 US$966 US$1.0k US$971 US$915 US$863 US$815 US$769 US$726 US$686\\n\\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\\n\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.4b\\n\\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the intial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 10-year government bond rate (1.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \\'growth\\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\\'s value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.\\n\\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2029 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 1.7%) ÷ 7.6%– 1.7%) = US$25b\\n\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$12b\\n\\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\\n\\nNYSE:A Intrinsic value April 1st 2020 More\\n\\nThe assumptions\\n\\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company\\'s future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Agilent Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\\'ve used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.086. Beta is a measure of a stock\\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\\n\\nStory continues',\n",

(NYSE: A) today announced the launch of the newest instrument in its Raman technology portfolio. The new Agilent Vaya Raman raw material identity verification system is a handheld instrument that accelerates quality control testing in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries.\\n\\nVaya verifies raw material identity through unopened transparent and non-transparent packaging, testing more containers for the same cost by reducing the need for sampling. Incoming goods can be tested quickly in the warehouse on receipt, reducing operator time and sample-handling booth usage. Testing through sealed containers also avoids handler exposure to high potency APIs and maintains the shelf life of sterile contents, helping to prevent unnecessary waste.\\n\\n\"Improving the speed and efficiency of raw material testing has a major impact on pharma and biopharma manufacturing,\" said Paul Loeffen, Agilent vice president and general manager of the company’s Molecular Spectroscopy Division. \"Testing requirements are trending toward higher volumes, even 100% of containers in many cases, and conventional techniques can be extremely resource-intensive. Vaya’s through-container capability bypasses the bottlenecks, offering our customers a significant cost- and resource-saving solution.\"\\n\\nVaya is the first true through-barrier handheld Raman instrument, incorporating Agilent’s spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) technology for fast ID of incoming goods through opaque containers in a GMP ready package. Vaya combines SORS with conventional Raman spectroscopy for maximum compatibility with a wide range of packaging–from clear glass vials and plastic bags to opaque plastics and paper sacks.\\n\\nAbout Agilent Technologies\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc.

The remaining business, CrossLab, supply labs software, sample preparation products, and laboratory instruments.\\n\\nSince early March, Agilent Technologies is down 21%, from $84. It is instructive to look back to see that the stock has huge upside potential at these levels.\\n\\nDuring the depths of the Great Recession, Agilent fell to under $10 in 2009 before increasing 9x over the next decade prior to the recent pullback. Starting in 2010, the company reported year-over-year increases in revenue, which is quite a feat.\\n\\nBusiness disruptions are a fact of life with the coronavirus and even Agilent is not immune. The good news is that the company will make up for these sales once things resume to normal since they are merely delayed, not lost.\\n\\nThe company can sustain long-term profitability given its strong market position in these markets, and, selling worldwide helps soften the blow when a region suffers. To put it simply, people need healthcare and these companies rely on Agilent for key items.\\n\\nRevenue continued to steadily advance, with fiscal 1Q20’s (ended January 31, 2020) top line rising 6% versus the year-ago period, to $1.4 billion. Profit fell to $220 million from $250 million due to higher Selling, General and Administrative costs.\\n\\nThere is $2.7 billion of debt, and we would like to see this reduced, while it has $1.2 billion in cash. With the industry’s relative stability and strong cash flow generation ($1 billion operating cash flow in FY19), we are not too concerned.\\n\\nSee also: Genuine Parts: A Long Track Record\\n\\nBMR Take: The company raised January’s quarterly dividend payout by 10% to $0.18, which is always a nice sign. We fully expect the stock to rebound and reach new heights, even if we can’t tell you when.\\n\\nThat being said, the bear market has left the price below our $74 Sell Price, so you need to decide if you want this to remain in your portfolio.

       "   'text': 'COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified late last year in Wuhan, China, was a dominant theme in the earnings releases and conference calls of S&P 500 companies in the recent earnings season as investors press for answers on how it will impact their financials.\\n\\nThere are now more than 101,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 3,400 deaths, according to a tally of cases published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Centers for Systems Science and Engineering.\\n\\nWith the December earnings season now all but over, many companies are having to review their guidance to incorporate the effect the virus is having on supply chains in Asia, as well as on consumer behavior across the globe. While most companies are still saying it’s too early to assess the full impact, many are attempting to offer some evaluation of lost sales or hits to earnings.\\n\\nThis is what companies have been saying:\\n\\n• 3M Co. MMM, +2.26% said demand for respirators is currently outpacing supply, and that increased demand for respirators during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 generated $250 million in revenue for the company. “That’s maybe the best frame to think about it for coronavirus at this point,” CEO Mike Roman said at an investor conference.\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, +11.33% expects an adverse impact of $60 million to $80 million on sales this year as a result of the outbreak. It has also lost $4 million “primarily from store closures in mainland China due to the coronavirus.” Abercrombie’s Asia-Pacific region made up less than 10% of 2019 sales, and its total manufacturing exposure to China was 22% in fiscal 2019. “We’ve given ourselves some provision I guess I would say on the European tourism business to continue to suffer a little bit as the travel restrictions get more and more intense,” CFO Scott Lipesky said during an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Agilent Techonologies Inc. A, +0.22% expects earnings of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion “after factoring in the potential impact” of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. “Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,” CFO Robert McMahon said. “This reduced the number of shipping days in China.”\\n\\nRead also:Consumer-facing companies will be the first hit if the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\\n\\n• Alcoa Corp. AA, +8.56% , which makes aluminum products, said it is seeing supply chain bottlenecks in China for bauxite, caustic and coal gas that are lowering production. “It’s driving a shortage of alumina inside of China, which is then starting to see the Chinese alumina price increase and you see the knock-on impact in the rest of the world with prices also increasing, pricing up by about $20 per ton over these last few weeks,” CEO Roy Harvey told investors.\\n\\n• American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +5.61% is reducing international and domestic capacity through the summer peak season as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The airline is cutting international capacity by 10%, including a 55% reduction in trans-Pacific capacity. In the U.S., the airline is cutting capacity by 7.5% in April.\\n\\n• Analog Devices Inc. ADI, +4.12% updated its guidance for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. “While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.55% is not expecting to meet second-quarter financial guidance because production has slowed or been halted in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Apple generates about 15% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there.\\n\\nRead also: Apple’s coronavirus warning wasn’t a total surprise, but magnitude rattles Wall Street\\n\\n• Best Buy Inc. BBY, +2.09% , which sources a lot of its consumer electronics products from China, said it assumes that most of the impact from the coronavirus will happen during the first half of the year. “Therefore, we view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said in a statement. “Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimates of the impacts at this time.” On the company’s earnings call, executives stressed that it was still a fluid situation and they are attempting to gauge when factories will be fully back up and running and whether global vendors have sufficient inventory.\\n\\n• Boston Scientific Corp. BSX, +0.98% , which has a $600 million business in China, is expecting a “negative first-half impact” on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. The company lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a “preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.”\\n\\n• Brown-Forman Corp. BF.B, +0.67% , the parent company of the Jack Daniel’s whiskey brand, lowered guidance to reflect global uncertainty and the effect of the coronavirus. The company is now expecting full-year earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.80, below the $1.82 FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• Capri Holdings Ltd. CPRI, +2.46% , which owns luxury brands Jimmy Choo and Versace, said it now expects annual revenue of $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50 as the virus eats into sales. That’s below the FactSet consensus for revenue of $5.78 billion and per-share earnings of $4.87.\\n\\nRead also:How much will COVID-19 hurt the U.S. economy? It’s anyone’s guess right now\\n\\n• Carnival Corp. CCL, +2.25% said there could be a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share impact of 55 cents to 65 cents if all operations are suspended in Asia through the end of April. If that comes to pass, according to Carnival, there would be a material impact on the business from suspended cruises in Chinese ports; cancellations in other parts of Asia; and the impact on bookings, which is determined by the length of time that an event influences travel.\\n\\n• The Coca-Cola Company KO, +2.13% said it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola’s global volume, the company said in January. “China’s economy was in a different place when SARS happened,” CEO James Quincey said in January. “It’s worth noting that China’s economy is [now] much bigger, and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.” In its 10-K filing with the SEC, the company also said it has seen delays in the production and export of ingredients used in nonnutritive sweeteners. It doesn’t expect a hit to its full-year results for now.\\n\\n• Crocs Inc. CROX, +6.04% expects first-quarter revenue to be hurt by $20 million to $30 million due to disruptions in Asia from the coronavirus. The casual shoe maker said many of its sellers in China remain closed, with those that are open seeing reduced operating hours and traffic, with traffic declines expanding throughout Asia.\\n\\n• Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +7.80% is reducing capacity by 15 points, implementing a hiring freeze, offering voluntary leave, and deferring spending as it struggles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The airline said it is cutting international capacity by 20% to 25% and domestic capacity by 10% to 15%.\\n\\n• Dollar General Inc. DG, -1.05% is “strongly encouraging” that the first hour of store operations be dedicated solely for senior shoppers, who are the most vulnerable to infection. “Dollar General wants to provide these at-risk customers with the ability to purchase the items they need and want at the beginning of each day to avoid busier and more crowded shopping periods,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Domino’s Pizza Inc. DPZ, +1.37% said that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino’s opened 80 net new stores in China.\\n\\n• Dow Inc. DOW, +2.53% expects the coronavirus to shave about $400 million off first-quarter sales, after business in China saw a 20% to 30% dip in sales. CFO Howard Ungerleider told an industrials conference that the chemicals company expects some additional sales impact, but that it is difficult to quantify for now. “However, if I had to size the total impact of COVID on our first quarter based on what I know today, both the impact in China and the knock-on impacts around the world, I would arrange the total impact to the Dow in the first quarter in the $200 million range on Ebitda,” the executive told attendees, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. DNKN, +2.85% has limited service to drive-through, carryout and delivery, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coffee and doughnut seller will remove tables and chairs from all its restaurants and outdoor patios to prevent the congregation of customers.\\n\\n• Ecolab Inc. ECL, +4.11% , a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. “If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,” he said, on an earnings call. “Before that, it didn’t exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.”\\n\\n• Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, -0.86% doesn’t expect any shortages of medicine, including insulin, as a result of the coronavirus. The company has been monitoring its supply chain for potential impact, and doesn’t source active pharmaceutical ingredients from China and insulin manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe have not been affected.\\n\\n• The Estée Lauder Cos. EL, +0.27% said the third quarter will be most impacted by the sales decline of luxury beauty products in China. The company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase of up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\n• Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, +5.84% is expecting a $30 million to $40 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. It also expects “some impact beyond [the first quarter] in 2020 as well,” CEO Barry Diller told investors. “But the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize.”\\n\\n• Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +4.07% is “looking to significantly reduce spending” in the near-term as a result of market conditions caused by the pandemic and commodity price decreases. “We will outline plans when they are finalized,” CEO Darren Woods said in a statement.\\n\\n• Foot Locker Inc. FL, +6.72% has closed stores across North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia and Malaysia through March 31. The athletic retailer has also withdrawn its full-year outlook and plans to provide an update with its first-quarter earnings announcement on May 22.\\n\\n• Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. FDP, +1.21% CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn’t expect the outbreak to fade away before April. “Usually these viruses, they don’t subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,” Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\\n\\n• General Electric Co. GE, +4.39% expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 13 cents, and negative free cash flow of about $2 billion. GE said while COVID-19 is an “evolving variable,” it currently expects a negative impact on first-quarter free cash flow of about $300 million to $500 million, and on operating income of $200 million to $300 million. The impacts are included in GE’s 2020 outlook.\\n\\n• General Mills Inc. GIS, -3.07% said half of its Häagen-Dazs shops in greater China are closed, and the shops that remain open have “severely restricted hours.” Greater China makes up 4% of General Mills’ net sales, 40% of its sales in the region are at Häagen-Dazs shops and other restaurants. The company told investors it can’t yet share how the closures will affect its numbers for fiscal 2020.\\n\\n• Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +1.55% is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for people with the new coronavirus. The drug maker plans to conduct a randomized, controlled trial in China as part of those plans, saying that remdesivir has shown “in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens” Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS, both of which are also coronaviruses.\\n\\n• Hasbro Inc. HAS, +5.27% continues “to have office and third-party factory closures” in China as a result of the outbreak. The company said that China is responsible for about two-thirds of its global sourcing. “The biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up,” said Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas. “Travel is limited, [and] places are still closed.”\\n\\n• Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. HPE, +3.92% told investors it no longer expects revenue to grow in fiscal 2020, with one executive telling MarketWatch that he blames a 16% year-over-year decline in compute revenue ($3 billion) and 9% decline in total revenue on “microenvironment” issues such as supply-chain disruption and the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT, +3.00% said about 150 hotels, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms, are closed in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, -2.23% expects its international business to have a “very difficult” second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. “Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,” CEO James Snee told investors.\\n\\n• HP Inc. HPQ, +6.77% said it expects a “negative impact to our top line, bottom line and [free cash flow],” citing delayed production and manufacturing timelines. The technology giant said when taking into account the outbreak, it now anticipates earnings per share of 46 cents to 50 cents and adjusted EPS of 49 cents to 53 cents.\\n\\n• HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC, +4.59% expects a weaker first-half performance in 2020, due to the downturn in Hong Kong and virus-related credit losses in the first quarter, it said. “The most extreme downside scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year,” an executive said on an earnings call. “If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional loan losses provisions required.”\\n\\n• InterContinental Hotels Group PLC IHG, +3.96% said 160 hotels are closed in China or closed to new guests. The company’s fee business is expected to take a $5 million hit in February in China, as a result of the outbreak. Its Chinese operations make up less than 10% of group operating profit. CEO Keith Barr told investors that the postponement and cancellation of conferences will have an impact on its operations, too. “What I saw during H1N1 and other times in China, the key thing to remember is the Chinese government’s ability to stimulate economic growth and activity is unlike any other country,” he said, on an earnings call.\\n\\n• Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. IPG, +4.27% and Meredith Corp. MDP, +4.93% separately told investors that the advertising is seeing a small slowdown. “We’ve seen a slight pullback in luxury advertising related to the travel category, a couple of airlines, not domestic airlines, but actually international airlines pulled back a little bit,” Meredith’s CEO Thomas Harty said at an investor conference. IPG’s Michael Roth said at the same event that the ad giant has “seen cutbacks before on the project side of the business.” He also noted that the temporary move to a work-from-home culture may lead to additional business. “Clients are going to need our expertise in allocating media dollars where the clients are, whether they’re working at home or whether the consumers are working at home, and how you address the marketplace that’s different,” he said.\\n\\nSee:Coronavirus is disrupting tech conferences across the globe — what to know\\n\\n• IQVIA Inc. IQV, +1.01% , which runs clinical trials, including in China, said it expects a $25 million impact in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. “The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China because that’s kind of the more dangerous spot right now,” CEO Ari Bousbib told investors.\\n\\n• ITT Inc. ITT, +5.34% updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\\n\\n• JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU, +9.31% said it will halt change and cancel fees for new flight bookings starting Thursday through March 11 for travel completed by June 1. “The policy is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns,” the airline said in a statement. The move will apply to all fares offered by JetBlue, including its cheapest fares, which generally do not allow for any changes or cancellations.\\n\\n• Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.27% expects a “modest impact” on sales of its skin care products as “people [are] buying less.\\n\\n• Lands’ End Inc. LE, +6.54% said the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in lower customer demand over the past week, and that it will not provide guidance for fiscal 2020 given the “rapidly changing business environment.”\\n\\n• L Brands Inc. LB, +8.98% closed all Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works stores in the U.S. and Canada through March 29 due to the pandemic. It also withdrew its guidance for the first quarter.\\n\\n• Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, +3.66% said that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to “monitor the situation” and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March.\\n\\n• Lyft Inc. LYFT, +8.71% reported its “biggest week in our history in terms of both revenue and rides,” potentially driven by fear of the contracting the coronavirus on public transportation, CFO Brian Roberts said at a technology summit.\\n\\n• Marriott International Inc. MAR, +4.48% said while it could not “fully estimate the financial impact” from COVID-19, it would be “material to first quarter and full-year 2020 results.”\\n\\n• Mastercard Inc. MA, +1.14% said it expects to shave 2 to 3 percentage points from its first-quarter revenue guidance because of the impact of COVID-19 on “cross-border travel and, to a lesser extent, cross-border e-commerce growth.”\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC MDT, -0.15% told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\nWhat It’s Like for Cruise Ship Passengers During Coronavirus Outbreak\\n\\n• Michaels Companies Inc. MIK, +6.26% gave guidance ahead of expectations but that didn’t take into account the impact of the coronavirus. Mark Cosby, Michaels CEO, said the company doesn’t expect “material supply chain disruptions” in the first quarter but sales in certain categories are slowing.\\n\\n• Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.24% warned that it will not meet guidance for its fiscal third quarter due to COVID-19. Microsoft in late January guided for fiscal third-quarter sales for its More Personal Computing segment of $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion, which “included a wider-than-usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.” While there’s “strong” demand for Windows in line with the company’s expectations, the supply chain “is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. All other components of its Q3 guidance remain unchanged, Microsoft said.\\n\\n• Mondelēz Inc. MDLZ, -0.24% told investors to expect “an impact on both revenue and margins” as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. “I’m quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don’t see at this point,” CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\\n\\n• Nike Inc. NKE, +3.34% has closed about half its stores in China, while the remaining stores are reporting lower-than-expected retail traffic. The athletic-apparel maker said it plans to provide an update about the impact of the virus on its third-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n• Nordstrom Inc. JWN, +9.28% closed its U.S. and Canadian stores, including Nordstrom full-line, Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club clubhouses and Jeffrey, for two weeks. The company’s online business, which accounted for one-third of sales in 2019, will remain in business. The company also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance offered on March 3, which didn’t include the impact of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, +3.39% expects the virus to shave off 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia — that’s 40 total — through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\\n\\n• OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. OSW, -0.57% , which provides on-board spa services to cruises, said in an earnings statement that it expects to lose $5 million in revenue and $2 million in adjusted EBITDA as a result of 141 canceled or modified voyages and lower revenue at its resort spas in Asia.\\n\\n• ON Semiconductor Corp. ON, +9.86% issued a revenue warning for the first quarter, due to the change in business conditions being created by the coronavirus. The Apple supplier now expects revenue to range from $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, compared with prior guidance of $1.355 billion to $1.405 billion, issued on Feb. 3. “We saw soft order trends in China in the weeks following Lunar New Year holidays, but orders have since picked up, and we have not seen any significant cancellations of orders,” CEO Keith Jackson said in a statement.\\n\\n• L’Oréal LRLCY, +4.06% said the impact from the outbreak will be temporary, based on the cosmetics maker’s experience with the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. What is different about this outbreak, however, is L’Oréal’s e-commerce sales of beauty products in China are stronger so far in February than they were this month last year. “This crisis will even strengthen the position of the e-commerce players in China,” CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors at an analyst conference.\\n\\n• Papa John’s International Inc. PZZA, -1.12% said it has closed about 50 franchised stores in China as a result of the outbreak. Although the pizza company said the impact of the store closures isn’t currently material to its earnings, uncertainty about the spread of the virus could “lead to lower sales [and] widespread store closures or delays in our supply chain, which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results.”\\n\\n• PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -0.45% expects the coronavirus to have a negative revenue impact of 1 percentage point for the March quarter and is expecting revenue for the quarter to fall toward the low end of its guidance of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion. “Stronger performance quarter-to-date across our diversified business is partially offsetting this one percentage point negative impact,” PayPal said.\\n\\n• Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.39% expects the outbreak to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant’s second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\\n\\n• PVH Corp. PVH, +10.88% , owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, said that 20% of its global sourcing comes from greater China, which also made up 7% of its 2019 revenue. Most PVH-owned stores in China remain closed. Still, the company reaffirmed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $1.79 for the fourth quarter and at least $9.45 for the full year.\\n\\n• Qorvo Inc. QRVO, +3.01% cut its revenue outlook, citing the estimated impact the coronavirus outbreak is having on the smartphone supply chain. The Apple Inc. supplier said it now expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of about $770 million, which is $50 million below the midpoint of the guidance range provided on Jan. 29 of $800 million to $840 million\\n\\n• Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, +8.02% said fiscal 2020 sales could be hurt by up to $70 million and operating income in Asia could take a $35 million to $45 million hit as a result of the outbreak. Two-thirds of the luxury retailer’s mainland China stores have been closed for a week, and about half of its stores were closed another week.\\n\\nSee:Large wave of new diagnoses said to have harmed confidence in China\\n\\n• Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +3.76% canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries as a result of the virus. The cruise-line operator said it expects an impact of 65 cents per share on its 2020 financial performance. If it has to cancel cruises in Asia through April, doing so would impact the company’s 2020 financial performance by an additional 55 cents a share.\\n\\n• Sabre Corp. SABR, +12.76% said the coronavirus will have a “material impact” on its 2020 results, as the outbreak has weighed on travel bookings so far this year. The company said the estimated impact for the first quarter of earnings per share of 14 cents to 23 cents and for revenue of $100 million to $150 million.\\n\\n• Sanderson Farms Inc. SAFM, -6.15% said the outbreak of African swine fever in China should eventually boost the poultry market in the U.S., but COVID-19 is now disrupting markets in China, depressing demand, hurting shipping and supply chain logistics and slowing China’s economic growth rate. The chicken meat producer said the Chinese lifting of the ban on chicken from the U.S. had led to orders for about 18 million pounds of chicken products.\\n\\n• Skechers USA Inc. SKX, +5.89% said the impact of COVID-19 had worsened since it last updated investors when it reported earnings on Feb. 6. Skechers offered guidance at that time for first-quarter sales of $1.400 billion to $1.425 billion, and earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents. “Things definitely have deteriorated to a degree,” CFO John Vandemore told investors at a UBS conference. He also said the big change is now coming in European countries that have experienced clusters of the illness, with Italy closing schools and universities.\\n\\n• Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, +5.62% CEO Gary Kelly told employees that he will take a 10% pay cut, as the company faces the worst downturn in decades as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\n• Spirit Airlines Inc. SAVE, +19.46% told investors they shouldn’t rely on its 2020 financial guidance given the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The discount air carrier said at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference that it has seen “significant pressure” on fares since the end of February and “modest” pressure on load factor.\\n\\n• Stanley Black & Decker Inc. SWK, +5.20% expects the outbreak to “cause some pressure for us in March and April from a revenue perspective,” according to remarks made by CFO Donald Allan at an investor conference. The company generates about $250 million in annual revenue in China and runs 10 plants there, which are operating at about 50% to 60% capacity, as of last week.\\n\\n• Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +2.31% , the Seattle-based coffee chain, said it was already “showing early signs of recovery” in China and that U.S. sales are still strong despite the coronavirus. “To date, there are no perceptible signs of COVID-19 impact on our U.S. business, which accounted for approximately 65% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020,” the coffee chain said in a financial filing. The company’s shareholder meeting will be “virtual only” this year due to the coronavirus.\\n\\n• TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, +7.73% said it may see a low-single-digit percentage impact on its financial results. “We do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we’re not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business,” CEO Stephen Kaufer told analysts.\\n\\n• Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, -3.84% has restarted some operations in China, but CEO Noel White said the company will face short-term impacts from the outbreak, even if the fallout eventually helps support government efforts in China to “decrease” the number of wet markets. Researchers believe that the virus, common to bats, may have been transmitted to humans via another animal sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan. “We’ll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China,” White said. “The combination of [African swine fever] and coronavirus would expedite that transition.”\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +9.27% expects to lose between $50 million and $60 million in sales to the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +12.50% rescinded its annual revenue guidance for 2020, saying the outbreak is too unpredictable to ensure that the forecast it issued two months ago will hold up. The airline will cut flight capacity by 10% domestically and 20% internationally in April due to the coronavirus outbreak. Executives Oscar Munoz and Scott Kirby will forego their base salaries, effective immediately through June 30, and the company has withdrawn its first-quarter guidance. Net bookings to Asia and Europe are down 100%; the company’s “dire scenario planning assumption” is that revenue will be down 70% in April and May. In comparison, demand was down 40% for the two months following 9/11. Kirby said he expects to recover demand within 18 months.\\n\\n• Urban Outfitters Inc.’s URBN, +9.17% store traffic and sales fell over the past week in cities including Milan and Seattle where the coronavirus is having a heavy impact. Other cities have been affected as well. The company, which also operates Anthropologie and Free People, said it can’t forecast how the company will be impacted in the first quarter because of the uncertainty around the outbreak.\\n\\n• Vail Resorts Inc. MTN, +2.74% said earnings and revenue were lower than analysts expected and rescinded its annual guidance as it sees business declining. “In the week ended March 8, 2020, we saw a marked negative change in performance from the prior week, with destination skier visits modestly below expectations,” Chief Executive Rob Katz said in a news release. “We expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in upcoming weeks.”\\n\\n• VF Corp. VFC, +7.83% , which owns the sneaker brand Vans, has closed 60% of its owned and partner stores in China. The shops that have remained open are reporting “significant” declines in retail traffic.\\n\\n• ViacomCBS Inc. VIAC, +4.02% is delaying the release of the “Sonic the Hedgehog” move in some Asian markets because of the outbreak, while MGM and Universal Studios said Wednesday that “No Time to Die,” the release of the next iteration of the James Bond movies, will be postponed until November.\\n\\n• Visa Inc. expects the outbreak to result in fiscal second-quarter revenue that is about 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points lower than the previously issued range of “low double-digit net revenue growth in constant dollars” that Visa gave with its latest earnings report in January. The company said the virus was having a “significant impact” on Asia-related travel that has caused a “sharp slowdown of our cross-border business” for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.37% anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. “Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,” Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\\n\\n• Walt Disney Co. DIS, +2.88% said if its shuttered Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks remain closed for months, it would shave $175 million off operating income in the current quarter. Disney’s movie-studio business could also take a hit, as cinemas are closed in China and Disney is preparing to launch the live-action “Mulan” reboot in March.\\n\\n• Wolverine World Wide Inc. WWW, +4.49% provided a downbeat full-year outlook, citing the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its shoe brands, which include Hush Puppies, Sperry, and Stride Rite. The company reported a net loss of $900,000, or 1 cent a share, in the latest quarter, after earnings of $39.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\n• Workday Inc. WDAY, +1.61% said it has pulled the plug on an internal sales conference in Orlando, Fla., set for next week that was expected to draw more than 3,000 people. The decision was made because of the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Xenia Hotels & Resorts Inc. XHR, +4.92% withdrew the 2020 guidance provided in late February, citing increased uncertainty regarding the financial impact resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. The real-estate investment trust that invests in luxury hotels said group cancellations have increased to $15 million of revenue since Feb. 24, while transient cancellations have increased significantly.\\n\\n• Yum China Holdings Inc. YUMC, +3.09% , which operates fast-food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For those that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing “significant interruption,” said Yum China Holdings CEO Joey Wat. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\\n\\n• Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. ZBH, +1.47% said the number of elective procedures in China, which makes up about 5% of global revenue, fell by up to 90% in February, and CFO Suketu Upadhyay expects that to continue through March “at a minimum.” There are also now early signs that procedures are slowing down in South Korea.\\n\\n• Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, +7.58% , which has seen its stock jump as more employers talk about having their workers work from home to prevent the spread of the virus, said all employees at its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., have been told to work from home. “We have definitely seen an uptick in usage, but a lot of that is on the free side,” Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg said during an earnings call.\\n\\nDon’t miss: Here are vulnerable parts of the U.S. economy that coronavirus may infect',\n",

       "   'text': 'Getty Images\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth care, which makes up nearly 18% of American GDP, has long been a fruitful hunting ground for investors seeking growth. And medical-tech and medical-device stocks have always been particularly compelling niches.\\n\\nNot only do these companies ride the coattails of inexorable health-care spending, but their commitment to research and development can create new industries that they can in turn dominate.\\n\\nIt\\'s not an easy time right now, of course. The COVID-19 outbreak has taken a chunk out of every sector and almost every industry, with only a few \"coronavirus stocks\" enjoying any meaningful gains. Medical devices have at least been better than the market, which has declined by about 29% in this bear market so far, as measured by the S&P 500. But the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) still has been cut to the tune of 25% in the same time frame.\\n\\nThat could provide investors with a chance to buy medical-device stocks and other med-tech plays at a significant discount, however. While their growth might be stunted in the short-term, their longer-term prospects are likely to improve again once the COVID-19 threat is contained - and a few are seeing additional business in the wake of the outbreak.\\n\\nHere, we look at six med-tech and medical-device stocks to buy.\\n\\nSEE ALSO: 10 Health and Pharmaceutical Companies Fighting the Coronavirus\\n\\nAgilent Technologies\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket value: $21.3 billion\\n\\nAgilent Technologies (A, $68.87) is a life sciences and medical devices company that deals in everything from analytical instruments and genomics software to lab management and diagnostic testing.\\n\\nAgilent had a few things going for it ahead of the coronavirus outbreak. For one, it closed on its $1.2 billion acquisition of Biotek in August, expanding the company\\'s presence in the cell analysis market.\\n\\nIt also attracted high-profile investor Pershine Square Capital, which accumulated a nearly 2.92 million-share stake in the second half of 2019. \"As of early November, its investment in Agilent had increased to 8.0%-9.5% of the firm\\'s equity portfolio, worth as much as $690 million,\" writes Value Line analyst Nils Van Liew. Pershing Square took only two new positions last year: Agilent and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). While Pershing has not indicated whether it will take an activist or passive role, the hedge fund clearly sees upside in the medical devices stock.\\n\\nAgilent has outperformed the market by about 10 percentage points since the start of the bear market on Feb. 19, losing just about 19%. Part of that was helped by results for its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31, Agilent reported 5.7% year-over-year growth in revenues, and a 7% improvement in profits to 81 cents per share. The company described its gains \"balanced ... across all regions and end markets\" - a promising sign for when the world begins to normalize again.\\n\\nSEE ALSO: 10 Solid Social Distancing Stocks to Buy\\n\\nQuest Diagnostics\\n\\nStory continues',\n",

       "   'text': 'Coronavirus is probably the #1 concern in investors’ minds right now. It should be. On February 27th we publish an article with the title \"Recession is Imminent: We Need A Travel Ban NOW\". We predicted that a US recession is imminent and US stocks will go down by at least 20% in the next 3-6 months. We also told you to short the market ETFs and buy long-term bonds. Investors who agreed with us and replicated these trades are up double digits whereas the market is down double digits. Our article also called for a total international travel ban to prevent the spread of the coronavirus especially from Europe. We were one step ahead of the markets and the president.\\n\\nIn these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. Our extensive research has shown that imitating the smart money can generate significant returns for retail investors, which is why we track nearly 835 active prominent money managers and analyze their quarterly 13F filings. The stocks that are heavily bought by hedge funds historically outperformed the market, though there is no shortage of high profile failures like hedge funds\\' 2018 losses in Facebook and Apple. Let’s take a closer look at what the funds we track think about Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) in this article.\\n\\nIs Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) a buy here? The smart money is taking a bullish view. The number of bullish hedge fund bets advanced by 5 lately. Our calculations also showed that A isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video below for Q3 rankings). Video: Click the image to watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\\n\\n5 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds More\\n\\nIn the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey\\'s monthly stock picks returned 72.9% since March 2017 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 41 percentage points. Our short strategy outperformed the S&P 500 short ETFs by 20 percentage points annually (see the details here). That\\'s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.\\n\\n[caption id=\"attachment_607931\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"399\"] Bill Ackman of Pershing Square[/caption]\\n\\nWe leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example Europe is set to become the world’s largest cannabis market, so we check out this European marijuana stock pitch. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences, and and go through short-term trade recommendations like this one. We even check out the recommendations of services with hard to believe track records. In January, we recommended a long position in one of the most shorted stocks in the market, and that stock returned more than 50% despite the large losses in the market since our recommendation.

       "   'text': 'In this article you are going to find out whether hedge funds think Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It\\'s not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) was in 35 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of March. A investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest in recent months. There were 46 hedge funds in our database with A positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that A isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds\\' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 51 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Both deliver even faster detection of target compounds providing customers increased sample throughput and reduced time to generate results.

Customers running a single chromatographic method for applications such as multi-residue screening will see greater data fidelity, reproducibility, and sensitivity. The system integrates seamlessly into existing analytical labs and customer workflows—and it offers quicker routine maintenance through the addition of VacShield technology, designed to easily remove ion injectors without venting.\\n\\nThe high-throughput RapidFire 400 integrated autosampler provides fast results with cycle times as short as 2 sec/sample and adds optional sample cooling for greater sample stability. The system includes barcode reading capabilities for sample tracking, now supports 1,536 well plates, and allows unattended operation for the analysis of more than 98,000 samples. It is further designed to integrate with the Ultivo LC/TQ system, further reducing lab space requirements.\\n\\nAbout Agilent Technologies\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, +0.65% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +3.00% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, +2.31% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +8.36% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals.

The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co.

Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +7.02% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +3.57% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.49% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, +1.34% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +9.27% UAA, +9.45% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our \"building and buying\" strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers\\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\\n\\nAnd now I\\'d like to introduce you to the host for today\\'s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nThank you, Jodi, and welcome everyone to Agilent\\'s conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. On the webcast today are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent\\'s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining for the Q&A after prepared remarks will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; and Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group, along with Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\\n\\nAnd now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Ankur and thanks, everyone for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.58 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 22.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this scientific instrument maker would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering no surprise.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\\n\\nAgilent, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.24 billion for the quarter ended April 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nAgilent shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -8%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Agilent?\\n\\nWhile Agilent has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $1.20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.95 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "   'text': 'After several years of lackluster returns, Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio) is having a blowout 2020. This comes off the back of a fantastic year in 2019 as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to its December update, Ackman\\'s hedge fund, Pershing Square Holdings, gained 4.5% in December, bringing its 2019 net performance to 58.1%.\\n\\nAckman\\'s run of good luck has continued into 2020. As of the beginning of this month, Pershing Square was up more than 17%. That\\'s compared to a double-digit decline for the S&P 500 over the same period.\\n\\nBig payoff\\n\\nAckman hit the headlines back in March when it was revealed that he\\'d made a 100-fold return on a hedging bet.\\n\\nPershing Square bought far out of the money protection against investment-grade and high-yield bond indexes, spending about $27 million for this protection. Ackman and his team bet that if volatility exploded, credit spreads would widen dramatically, putting what has been described as their \"ultra-convex bets\" in the money and generating a huge payoff.\\n\\nThat\\'s just what happened. Ackman reportedly booked a $2.6 billion gain on the trade when volatility spiked in March.\\n\\nThis gave the hedge fund manager a considerable war chest to invest in the market when stock prices for many companies had reached multi-year lows. Ackman used this cash to increase holdings in some of his favorite positions while buying new stakes in others.\\n\\nAckman\\'s buys\\n\\nAccording to Pershing Square\\'s latest 13F filing, the activist hedge fund manager nearly doubled his position in home improvement retailer Lowe\\'s Cos (NYSE:LOW) during the first quarter. The position now accounts for 16% of his portfolio and was worth just over $1 billion at the end of March.\\n\\nAckman first invested in Lowe\\'s back in 2018. Writing in his 2018 annual shareholder letter, the activist investor said that he was attracted to the company due to its ambitions to increase profit margins to 12% over the medium-term from 9.2%. The company aims to improve operations to a similar caliber as that of peer Home Depot (NYSE:HD), which has margins of nearly 15%.\\n\\nAckman also used his windfall to increase Pershing Square\\'s stake in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B). Commenting on the position in 2019, the hedge fund manager said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The catalyst for our current investment in Berkshire is our view that the company is currently trading at one of the widest discounts to its intrinsic value in many years, at a time when we expect the operating performance of its subsidiaries to improve as a result of certain managerial and organizational changes at the company.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the stock has only continued to fall in 2020, it seems reasonable to speculate that Ackman believes the company is substantially more undervalued today than it was last year.\\n\\nAckman also substantially increased his position in Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A). The fund increased the holding by nearly 300% to just over 12.6 million shares. It now has a 14% portfolio weight.\\n\\nHe also increased his position in Howard Hughes Corp (NYSE:HHC) by 455%. The position is now 12.2 million shares, worth just over $616 million.\\n\\nTwo additions to the portfolio in the quarter were The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK). These are currently quite small positions in the portfolio. They make up just 0.4% and 0.8% of the equity portfolio, respectively. It\\'ll be interesting to see if the hedge fund manager continues to acquire shares in these companies over the next few months. He traditionally owns a concentrated portfolio of investments, with an average portfolio weight of 10%.\\n\\nDisclosure: The author owns shares in Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\nRead more here:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered in-line results.\\n\\nThe stock outperformed earnings estimates twice, matched once and missed on another occasion in the last four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 1.9%.\\n\\nTrend in Estimate Revision\\n\\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has declined 7.9% to 58 cents per share over the past 30 days. This indicates a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying a decline of 4.97% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nAmazon. com has successfully invaded many different businesses—but Covid-19 testing? The company said during its recent earnings call that it expects to spend $4 billion or more in the second quarter responding to the pandemic. Among other things, it is spending “hundreds of millions to develop our own Covid-19 testing capabilities.”\\n\\nThis news has Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wondering if Amazon might evolve into a major Covid-19 testing player. “We believe the goal is to create Covid-19 testing stations that Amazon employees can pass through on a daily basis,” Nowak writes in a note. “Amazon expects to spend $1 billion on this initiative between April and the end of 2020.”\\n\\nNowak believes Amazon will work on a rapid saliva test. He’s upbeat, despite many unmet promises around testing and Amazon’s lack of experience. He ticks off three challenges, which, he says, play to its strengths. One is supply chain. “The tests will need to be produced in massive quantities and manufacturing capacity built quickly,” he writes. The second is optimization of a test likely to struggle with efficiency and accuracy. The third is capital; Amazon is flush.\\n\\nWhy would Amazon want to get into testing? Nowak, who has an Overweight rating and a $2,600 target price for the stock, argues that employee and customer safety could become a competitive edge in e-commerce. “The potential public goodwill created through [sharing] this cannot be valued, and in a world where tech regulation is a recurring topic, could be a game changer,” he writes.\\n\\nAmazon itself is playing things down. “We’re not sure how far we will get in the relevant time frame, but we think it’s worth trying,” Amazon said.\\n\\nThis Week\\n\\nMonday 5/18\\n\\nThe World Health Organization holds its 73rd World Health Assembly.

Consensus estimates are for a 34.5 reading, up from April’s 30 figure.

       "   'title': 'Earnings Preview: Agilent Technologies (A) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline',\n",
       "   'text': \"The market expects Agilent Technologies (A) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2020. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 21, 2020, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.3%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $1.18 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent?\\n\\nFor Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -18.88%.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose above 71,000 on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump appeared to back off his announcement that he would phase out the government task force created to manage the pandemic.\\n\\nTrump said on a visit to Arizona on Tuesday that he would be winding down the task force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence and includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, another public-health expert who is White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted that the force would continue its work indefinitely, although it may add or subtract members over time as it refocuses on reopening the economy, along with vaccines and therapeutics.\\n\\nTrump has been pushing to reopen an economy that all but closed down amid stay-at-home orders from governors seeking to contain the spread and avoid overwhelming hospitals and health-care workers. The president has tweeted support for protesters in states including Michigan against restrictions on movement.\\n\\nDemocrats had criticized the plan to wind down the task force, given the U.S. is still seeing increases in case numbers and deaths. Trump acknowledged that reopening would possibly result in more deaths but said, “we can’t sit in the house for the next three years.”\\n\\nA group of young volunteers recruited by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner that was tasked with securing personal protective equipment, or PPE, for frontline workers were told to prioritize tips from political allies and associates of the president, the New York Times reported.\\n\\nCiting emails and documents obtained by their reporters, the paper said few of the leads actually panned out and the volunteers, who had no experience in procurement, were confused and overwhelmed by the task. PPE has been in short supply across the U.S. since the start of the outbreak and is reported to have contributed to infections among health-care and other medical workers.\\n\\nRead: Your genes could determine whether coronavirus puts you in the hospital — and we’re starting to unravel which ones matter\\n\\nIn the U.K., a scientist and top government adviser on the pandemic resigned after he was caught breaking lockdown rules. Prof. Neil Ferguson quit the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment,” as the Guardian reported. The move came after a Daily Telegraph report revealed that Ferguson’s lover had crossed London to visit him at least twice after lockdown measures were implemented.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThe U.K.’s case tally crossed 200,000 on Wednesday and it now has the highest death toll in Europe, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K. has 202,355 cases and 30,150 deaths, putting its death toll ahead of Italy’s, which was an early hot spot. Official numbers from the U.K. have a slightly different tally.\\n\\nThere are 3.71 million cases of COVID-19 globally and 259,695 people have died. At least 1.2 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case toll at 1.21 million and the highest death toll at 71,463.\\n\\nSpain has the highest number of cases in Europe at 219,329 and 25,613 deaths. Italy has 214,457 cases and 29,684 deaths.\\n\\nFrance has 170,694 cases and 25,538 deaths.

China, where the disease was first reported late last year, has 83,968 cases and 4,637 deaths.\\n\\nWhat’s the latest medical news?\\n\\nAdaptive Biotechnologies Corp. ADPT, +2.16% has launched a virtual clinical study with Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.24% aimed at better understanding the immune response in 1,000 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus.\\n\\nThe study will use diagnostic tests made by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings LH, -0.35% , who will send employees to the participants’ homes to collect the samples, which will then be used to examine patients’ T-cells.

Mid-size companies, defined as having 50 to 499 workers, shed 5.3 million jobs, large businesses with 500 employees or more axed 8.9 million jobs.\\n\\nHealth-care jobs were not immune as the pandemic causes a steep decline in treatments for non-virus conditions and the postponement of elective procedures, the data show. Health-care companies cut almost a million jobs.

DIS, +2.88% said profit fell more than 90% in its fiscal second quarter, as parks were ordered to close, film production stalled and TV advertising was disrupted. Disney has faced some of the biggest fears from Wall Street about its business during the coronavirus crisis, as its largest units are centered around on-premise interactions that have been shut down during shelter-in-place orders: Theme parks and cruise lines, movies and live sports, for example.\\n\\nAnalysts said the company’s release prompted more questions than answers and criticized the lack of detail on what lies ahead on the earnings call.\\n\\n“Of course we did not expect Disney to opine on timing of openings for Parks, theaters, sports, or content production,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote. “However, we had hoped for better clarity on Parks burn rate when closed, margin profile when opened at reduced capacity, operating rules/implications/parameters for operating in a pre-vaccine world.”\\n\\nFor more, see:Disney earnings leave more questions than answers as COVID-19 pressures theme parks and more\\n\\nThere was better news from videogame makers Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, -4.19% and Electronic Arts Inc. EA, -3.62% , which both reported healthy increases in sales and profit as Americans sheltering in place switched to the virtual world for entertainment.\\n\\nThe companies don’t expect much change: EA predicted profits this quarter would triple from the year before to more than a quarter-billion dollars, while Activision forecast adjusted profit of more than $500 million, a 67% increase.\\n\\nSee also:Videogames are flourishing in the pandemic, and game makers aren’t scared of the future\\n\\nBeyond Meat Inc. BYND, -0.71% said disruption in the meat supply chain as facilities with infected worker are forced to close has been a boost to its lineup of meat substitutes and plant-based products. Beyond Meat reported fiscal first-quarter results that blew past Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 7% in extended trading. Shares have surged 85% since March 18, as retailers request “expedited” deliveries to refill shelves across the country, a company spokesperson said.\\n\\nRival Impossible Foods, which is privately held for now, also reported business that was “full steam ahead.”\\n\\nFor more, read:Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat see spike in demand as coronavirus wreaks havoc on meat supply\\n\\nGeneral Motors Co. GM, +6.05% delivered another surprise with the car maker beating expectations for profit and revenue despite the steep slowdown in car sales during the pandemic.\\n\\nHere’s the latest things companies are saying about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. A, +0.22% has started to reopen stores that were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic in those locations where regulations allow it. “We are optimistic for the future and we’re happy to announce that we have begun to open select stores globally on a rolling basis and will continue to do so in the weeks ahead,” Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said in a regulatory filing. “We will open stores as State and local regulations allow and as we are able to meet the applicable safety and health standards.”\\n\\n• Bunge Ltd. BG, +3.81% reported a surprise first-quarter loss, revenue that fell below expectations and provided a downbeat full-year outlook, saying that while it didn’t experience a significant disruption to its business from the pandemic, it did start to see the negative impact of a change in consumer behavior in its edible oils business in March. “Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,” said Chief Executive Greg Heckman. The company said it expects 2020 EPS to be lower than its original expectation.\\n\\n• CVS Health Corp. CVS, +0.01% reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, as its pharmacy and retail business got a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pharmacy businesses benefited from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19-related lockdowns. CVS affirmed its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is above the current FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• General Motors reported first-quarter profit and revenue that fell, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to suspended operations, but beat expectations as U.S. truck sales rose sharply. GM’s U.S. sales fell 7%, driven by the negative effects of the pandemic, but sales of full-size pickups rose 27%, with market share increasing to 41%. Among actions GM has taken to preserve cash during the pandemic include suspension of its dividend and share repurchases, salary cuts and drawing on its credit facilities.\\n\\n• Office Depot Inc. ODP, +4.31% posted first-quarter earnings that blew past estimates. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Office Depot had liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end, its highest net cash position in two years. “Our B2B focus is helping businesses remain operational in the home or at the office, our facilities have largely remained open serving customers with enhanced sanitation and safety protocols, and our e-commerce platform and retail stores are proving to be trusted means for customers to access the critical products and services they need,” Chief Executive Gerry Smith said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 2% in the quarter and e-commerce sales saw a strong jump in demand, he said. The company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance given the uncertainty around the pandemic and is suspending temporarily its share buybacks and dividend payments. Separately, it announced that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to block any party from taking advantage of a falling share price to build a stake in the company.\\n\\n• Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. SPR, +21.34% swung to a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter on revenue that fell less than forecast. The suspension of Boeing Co’s BA, +12.94% production of the 737 MAX plane led to lower margins as given “abnormal” costs associated with the pandemic. Actions the company has taken to preserve liquidity and cut costs amid the 737 MAX groundings and the COVID-19 pandemic include cutting the dividend, suspending share buybacks, deferring repayments of an advance from Boeing and cutting jobs and work schedules. The company will not provide 2020 financial guidance given the continued uncertainties surrounding the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic.\\n\\n• United Airlines Inc. UAL, +12.50% is offering $2.25 billion in senior secured notes in a private offering. The bonds will be offered in two tranches maturing in 2023 and 2025. Proceeds of the deal will be used to repay a $2.0 billion term loan entered into in March and for general corporate purposes. Airlines have been tapping credit lines and government relief plans with most fleets grounded during the pandemic.\\n\\n• Wendy’s Co. WEN, +1.09% reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. Wendy’s had a cash balance of $365 million as of May 3 after fully drawing down its revolving financing facility, reducing its second-quarter dividend and taking other measures due to the pandemic. Nearly all (96%) of Wendy’s restaurants are operating, including 99% in the U.S., with drive-through and delivery only. Wendy’s has said that disruptions to the beef supply chain has put limits on the availability of certain menu items.',\n",

       "   'title': \"Agilent Technologies, Inc. -- Moody's assigns P-2 rating to Agilent's new commercial paper program, affirms Baa2 rating, outlook stable\",\n",
       "   'text': 'NOTE: On May 05, 2020, the press release was corrected as follows: In the debt list, for Agilent Technologies, Inc., under “Outlook action” was changed to “Maintained, Stable.” Revised release follows.\\n\\nNew York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody\\'s Investors Service, (\"Moody\\'s) assigned a P-2 short term rating to Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\'s (\"Agilent\") new $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Concurrently, Moody\\'s affirmed the Baa2 senior unsecured rating. The outlook is stable.\\n\\nThe new $1.0 billion program is supported by Agilent\\'s $1.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring March 2024. Moody\\'s anticipates that Agilent will not issue more under its CP program than is available under its revolving credit facility at any given time, to maintain full back-stop under the program. The credit agreement has no material adverse change clause or material adverse event language related to litigation that would restrict borrowings. The revolver has same-day availability for US borrowings.\\n\\nThe P-2 rating reflects Agilent\\'s excellent liquidity, the company had $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash at January 31, 2020, offset by approximately $675 million of short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt. Agilent has full availability under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The revolver contains financial maintenance covenants. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is currently set at 3.5x, and Moody\\'s expects the company will maintain ample cushion under the leverage covenant.\\n\\nThe rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, the deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The life science tools and services sector has been one of the sectors adversely affected by the shock.\\n\\nMore specifically, Agilent will be impacted by the temporary closure of some research labs, deferral of customers\\' spending on expensive capital equipment and reduced demand from certain economically sensitive industrial and applied end-markets. Further, reduced physician visits and the deferral of healthcare services will also negatively impact demand for certain clinical diagnostics products. Moody\\'s regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, the affirmation of the Baa2 rating reflects Moody\\'s views that Agilent is well positioned at the current Baa2 rating. This reflects the company\\'s strong market positions, diversification both in terms of geographies and end-markets, and conservative financial policies -- as evidenced by leverage that is modest for the Baa2 rating. Further, Agilent has taken steps to adjust its cost base and manage cash conservatively, which includes the suspension of its share buyback program.\\n\\nMoody\\'s took the following rating actions for Agilent Technologies Inc.:\\n\\nAssignments:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\n....Commercial Paper, Assigned P-2\\n\\nRatings affirmed:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nSenior unsecured, at Baa2\\n\\nOutlook action:\\n\\nMaintained, Stable\\n\\nRATINGS RATIONALE\\n\\nThe Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating reflects Agilent\\'s favorable scale, strong competitive positions, attractive growth prospects across key markets, good customer and geographic diversification, moderate leverage, and excellent liquidity. Agilent\\'s ratings also reflect Moody\\'s expectations that the company will maintain conservative financial policies with debt/EBITDA approaching 2.0x in the next 12-18 months. The company\\'s rating is constrained by a relatively high reliance on revenue generated from the sale of expensive equipment used in analytical laboratories. This increases Agilent\\'s sensitivity to economic cycles.\\n\\nReflecting the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the lost business days by the customers of life science companies such as Agilent will temporarily reduce the demand for certain consumable products. Further, some equipment purchases will be delayed. The company\\'s operations, products and services are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for handling, storing and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. An inability to adhere to such standards could result in financial penalties and remediation costs. However, the company applies strict standards for the protection of the environment and occupational health, and high safety standards that help mitigate this risk. Agilent maintains a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. In terms of governance, the company has a track record of maintaining low financial leverage and ample liquidity.\\n\\nThe stable outlook reflects Moody\\'s view that Agilent will maintain its strong market leadership, remain well diversified, and maintain conservative financial policies.\\n\\nFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS\\n\\nRatings could be upgraded if the company is able to generate higher levels of recurring revenue relative to total sales and further strengthens operating performance. Quantitatively, ratings could be upgraded if debt/EBITDA was sustained below 2.0 times.\\n\\nRatings could be downgraded in the event of significant market share erosion, or severe contraction in its key markets. Ratings could also be downgraded in the event of a large debt financed acquisition or shareholder distribution. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if debt to EBITDA was sustained above 3.0 times.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (\"Agilent\") is a leading manufacturer of laboratory equipment and products used in clinical diagnostics. Key product platforms include liquid and gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers, which have applications in a variety of end markets including healthcare, food, chemical and environmental industries. Agilent reports three business segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (\"LSAG\"), Diagnostics and Genomics (\"DGG\") and Agilent CrossLab Group (\"ACG\"). The Life Science and Applied Markets segment sells instruments and software that identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. DGG sells products that help customers obtain data from cellular and molecular samples. ACG sells chemistries, supplies, services and software that help to improve productivity inside its customers\\' labs. The company generates annual revenue of $5.2 billion.\\n\\nThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Medical Product and Device Industry published in June 2017 and available at https://www.moodys.com/research/Medical-Product-and-Device-Industry--PBC_1071635.

       "   'title': \"Did Agilent Technologies' (NYSE:A) Share Price Deserve to Gain 80%?\",\n",
       "   'text': \"When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) share price is up 80% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (ignoring dividends).\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies\\n\\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\\n\\nOver half a decade, Agilent Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 32% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\\n\\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\\n\\nNYSE:A Past and Future Earnings May 1st 2020 More\\n\\nThis free interactive report on Agilent Technologies's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\\n\\nWhat About Dividends?\\n\\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Agilent Technologies, it has a TSR of 89% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nInvestors in Agilent Technologies had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.4% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 1.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Agilent Technologies that you should be aware of.\\n\\nOf course Agilent Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.\\n\\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.\\n\\nIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com. This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation. Simply Wall St has no position in the stocks mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe aim to bring you long-term focused research analysis driven by fundamental data.

       "   'text': 'COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified late last year in Wuhan, China, was a dominant theme in the earnings releases and conference calls of S&P 500 companies in the recent earnings season as investors press for answers on how it will impact their financials.\\n\\nThere are now more than 101,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 3,400 deaths, according to a tally of cases published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Centers for Systems Science and Engineering.\\n\\nWith the December earnings season now all but over, many companies are having to review their guidance to incorporate the effect the virus is having on supply chains in Asia, as well as on consumer behavior across the globe. While most companies are still saying it’s too early to assess the full impact, many are attempting to offer some evaluation of lost sales or hits to earnings.\\n\\nThis is what companies have been saying:\\n\\n• 3M Co. MMM, +2.26% said demand for respirators is currently outpacing supply, and that increased demand for respirators during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 generated $250 million in revenue for the company. “That’s maybe the best frame to think about it for coronavirus at this point,” CEO Mike Roman said at an investor conference.\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, +11.33% expects an adverse impact of $60 million to $80 million on sales this year as a result of the outbreak. It has also lost $4 million “primarily from store closures in mainland China due to the coronavirus.” Abercrombie’s Asia-Pacific region made up less than 10% of 2019 sales, and its total manufacturing exposure to China was 22% in fiscal 2019. “We’ve given ourselves some provision I guess I would say on the European tourism business to continue to suffer a little bit as the travel restrictions get more and more intense,” CFO Scott Lipesky said during an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Agilent Techonologies Inc. A, +0.22% expects earnings of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion “after factoring in the potential impact” of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. “Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,” CFO Robert McMahon said. “This reduced the number of shipping days in China.”\\n\\nRead also:Consumer-facing companies will be the first hit if the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\\n\\n• Alcoa Corp. AA, +8.56% , which makes aluminum products, said it is seeing supply chain bottlenecks in China for bauxite, caustic and coal gas that are lowering production. “It’s driving a shortage of alumina inside of China, which is then starting to see the Chinese alumina price increase and you see the knock-on impact in the rest of the world with prices also increasing, pricing up by about $20 per ton over these last few weeks,” CEO Roy Harvey told investors.\\n\\n• American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +5.61% is reducing international and domestic capacity through the summer peak season as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The airline is cutting international capacity by 10%, including a 55% reduction in trans-Pacific capacity. In the U.S., the airline is cutting capacity by 7.5% in April.\\n\\n• Analog Devices Inc. ADI, +4.12% updated its guidance for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. “While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.55% is not expecting to meet second-quarter financial guidance because production has slowed or been halted in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Apple generates about 15% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there.\\n\\nRead also: Apple’s coronavirus warning wasn’t a total surprise, but magnitude rattles Wall Street\\n\\n• Best Buy Inc. BBY, +2.09% , which sources a lot of its consumer electronics products from China, said it assumes that most of the impact from the coronavirus will happen during the first half of the year. “Therefore, we view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said in a statement. “Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimates of the impacts at this time.” On the company’s earnings call, executives stressed that it was still a fluid situation and they are attempting to gauge when factories will be fully back up and running and whether global vendors have sufficient inventory.\\n\\n• Boston Scientific Corp. BSX, +0.98% , which has a $600 million business in China, is expecting a “negative first-half impact” on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. The company lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a “preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.”\\n\\n• Brown-Forman Corp. BF.B, +0.67% , the parent company of the Jack Daniel’s whiskey brand, lowered guidance to reflect global uncertainty and the effect of the coronavirus. The company is now expecting full-year earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.80, below the $1.82 FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• Capri Holdings Ltd. CPRI, +2.46% , which owns luxury brands Jimmy Choo and Versace, said it now expects annual revenue of $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50 as the virus eats into sales. That’s below the FactSet consensus for revenue of $5.78 billion and per-share earnings of $4.87.\\n\\nRead also:How much will COVID-19 hurt the U.S. economy? It’s anyone’s guess right now\\n\\n• Carnival Corp. CCL, +2.25% said there could be a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share impact of 55 cents to 65 cents if all operations are suspended in Asia through the end of April. If that comes to pass, according to Carnival, there would be a material impact on the business from suspended cruises in Chinese ports; cancellations in other parts of Asia; and the impact on bookings, which is determined by the length of time that an event influences travel.\\n\\n• The Coca-Cola Company KO, +2.13% said it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola’s global volume, the company said in January. “China’s economy was in a different place when SARS happened,” CEO James Quincey said in January. “It’s worth noting that China’s economy is [now] much bigger, and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.” In its 10-K filing with the SEC, the company also said it has seen delays in the production and export of ingredients used in nonnutritive sweeteners. It doesn’t expect a hit to its full-year results for now.\\n\\n• Crocs Inc. CROX, +6.04% expects first-quarter revenue to be hurt by $20 million to $30 million due to disruptions in Asia from the coronavirus. The casual shoe maker said many of its sellers in China remain closed, with those that are open seeing reduced operating hours and traffic, with traffic declines expanding throughout Asia.\\n\\n• Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +7.80% is reducing capacity by 15 points, implementing a hiring freeze, offering voluntary leave, and deferring spending as it struggles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The airline said it is cutting international capacity by 20% to 25% and domestic capacity by 10% to 15%.\\n\\n• Dollar General Inc. DG, -1.05% is “strongly encouraging” that the first hour of store operations be dedicated solely for senior shoppers, who are the most vulnerable to infection. “Dollar General wants to provide these at-risk customers with the ability to purchase the items they need and want at the beginning of each day to avoid busier and more crowded shopping periods,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Domino’s Pizza Inc. DPZ, +1.37% said that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino’s opened 80 net new stores in China.\\n\\n• Dow Inc. DOW, +2.53% expects the coronavirus to shave about $400 million off first-quarter sales, after business in China saw a 20% to 30% dip in sales. CFO Howard Ungerleider told an industrials conference that the chemicals company expects some additional sales impact, but that it is difficult to quantify for now. “However, if I had to size the total impact of COVID on our first quarter based on what I know today, both the impact in China and the knock-on impacts around the world, I would arrange the total impact to the Dow in the first quarter in the $200 million range on Ebitda,” the executive told attendees, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. DNKN, +2.85% has limited service to drive-through, carryout and delivery, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coffee and doughnut seller will remove tables and chairs from all its restaurants and outdoor patios to prevent the congregation of customers.\\n\\n• Ecolab Inc. ECL, +4.11% , a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. “If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,” he said, on an earnings call. “Before that, it didn’t exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.”\\n\\n• Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, -0.86% doesn’t expect any shortages of medicine, including insulin, as a result of the coronavirus. The company has been monitoring its supply chain for potential impact, and doesn’t source active pharmaceutical ingredients from China and insulin manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe have not been affected.\\n\\n• The Estée Lauder Cos. EL, +0.27% said the third quarter will be most impacted by the sales decline of luxury beauty products in China. The company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase of up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\n• Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, +5.84% is expecting a $30 million to $40 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. It also expects “some impact beyond [the first quarter] in 2020 as well,” CEO Barry Diller told investors. “But the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize.”\\n\\n• Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +4.07% is “looking to significantly reduce spending” in the near-term as a result of market conditions caused by the pandemic and commodity price decreases. “We will outline plans when they are finalized,” CEO Darren Woods said in a statement.\\n\\n• Foot Locker Inc. FL, +6.72% has closed stores across North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia and Malaysia through March 31. The athletic retailer has also withdrawn its full-year outlook and plans to provide an update with its first-quarter earnings announcement on May 22.\\n\\n• Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. FDP, +1.21% CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn’t expect the outbreak to fade away before April. “Usually these viruses, they don’t subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,” Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\\n\\n• General Electric Co. GE, +4.39% expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 13 cents, and negative free cash flow of about $2 billion. GE said while COVID-19 is an “evolving variable,” it currently expects a negative impact on first-quarter free cash flow of about $300 million to $500 million, and on operating income of $200 million to $300 million. The impacts are included in GE’s 2020 outlook.\\n\\n• General Mills Inc. GIS, -3.07% said half of its Häagen-Dazs shops in greater China are closed, and the shops that remain open have “severely restricted hours.” Greater China makes up 4% of General Mills’ net sales, 40% of its sales in the region are at Häagen-Dazs shops and other restaurants. The company told investors it can’t yet share how the closures will affect its numbers for fiscal 2020.\\n\\n• Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +1.55% is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for people with the new coronavirus. The drug maker plans to conduct a randomized, controlled trial in China as part of those plans, saying that remdesivir has shown “in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens” Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS, both of which are also coronaviruses.\\n\\n• Hasbro Inc. HAS, +5.27% continues “to have office and third-party factory closures” in China as a result of the outbreak. The company said that China is responsible for about two-thirds of its global sourcing. “The biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up,” said Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas. “Travel is limited, [and] places are still closed.”\\n\\n• Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. HPE, +3.92% told investors it no longer expects revenue to grow in fiscal 2020, with one executive telling MarketWatch that he blames a 16% year-over-year decline in compute revenue ($3 billion) and 9% decline in total revenue on “microenvironment” issues such as supply-chain disruption and the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT, +3.00% said about 150 hotels, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms, are closed in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, -2.23% expects its international business to have a “very difficult” second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. “Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,” CEO James Snee told investors.\\n\\n• HP Inc. HPQ, +6.77% said it expects a “negative impact to our top line, bottom line and [free cash flow],” citing delayed production and manufacturing timelines. The technology giant said when taking into account the outbreak, it now anticipates earnings per share of 46 cents to 50 cents and adjusted EPS of 49 cents to 53 cents.\\n\\n• HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC, +4.59% expects a weaker first-half performance in 2020, due to the downturn in Hong Kong and virus-related credit losses in the first quarter, it said. “The most extreme downside scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year,” an executive said on an earnings call. “If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional loan losses provisions required.”\\n\\n• InterContinental Hotels Group PLC IHG, +3.96% said 160 hotels are closed in China or closed to new guests. The company’s fee business is expected to take a $5 million hit in February in China, as a result of the outbreak. Its Chinese operations make up less than 10% of group operating profit. CEO Keith Barr told investors that the postponement and cancellation of conferences will have an impact on its operations, too. “What I saw during H1N1 and other times in China, the key thing to remember is the Chinese government’s ability to stimulate economic growth and activity is unlike any other country,” he said, on an earnings call.\\n\\n• Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. IPG, +4.27% and Meredith Corp. MDP, +4.93% separately told investors that the advertising is seeing a small slowdown. “We’ve seen a slight pullback in luxury advertising related to the travel category, a couple of airlines, not domestic airlines, but actually international airlines pulled back a little bit,” Meredith’s CEO Thomas Harty said at an investor conference. IPG’s Michael Roth said at the same event that the ad giant has “seen cutbacks before on the project side of the business.” He also noted that the temporary move to a work-from-home culture may lead to additional business. “Clients are going to need our expertise in allocating media dollars where the clients are, whether they’re working at home or whether the consumers are working at home, and how you address the marketplace that’s different,” he said.\\n\\nSee:Coronavirus is disrupting tech conferences across the globe — what to know\\n\\n• IQVIA Inc. IQV, +1.01% , which runs clinical trials, including in China, said it expects a $25 million impact in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. “The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China because that’s kind of the more dangerous spot right now,” CEO Ari Bousbib told investors.\\n\\n• ITT Inc. ITT, +5.34% updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\\n\\n• JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU, +9.31% said it will halt change and cancel fees for new flight bookings starting Thursday through March 11 for travel completed by June 1. “The policy is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns,” the airline said in a statement. The move will apply to all fares offered by JetBlue, including its cheapest fares, which generally do not allow for any changes or cancellations.\\n\\n• Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.27% expects a “modest impact” on sales of its skin care products as “people [are] buying less.\\n\\n• Lands’ End Inc. LE, +6.54% said the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in lower customer demand over the past week, and that it will not provide guidance for fiscal 2020 given the “rapidly changing business environment.”\\n\\n• L Brands Inc. LB, +8.98% closed all Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works stores in the U.S. and Canada through March 29 due to the pandemic. It also withdrew its guidance for the first quarter.\\n\\n• Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, +3.66% said that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to “monitor the situation” and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March.\\n\\n• Lyft Inc. LYFT, +8.71% reported its “biggest week in our history in terms of both revenue and rides,” potentially driven by fear of the contracting the coronavirus on public transportation, CFO Brian Roberts said at a technology summit.\\n\\n• Marriott International Inc. MAR, +4.48% said while it could not “fully estimate the financial impact” from COVID-19, it would be “material to first quarter and full-year 2020 results.”\\n\\n• Mastercard Inc. MA, +1.14% said it expects to shave 2 to 3 percentage points from its first-quarter revenue guidance because of the impact of COVID-19 on “cross-border travel and, to a lesser extent, cross-border e-commerce growth.”\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC MDT, -0.15% told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\nWhat It’s Like for Cruise Ship Passengers During Coronavirus Outbreak\\n\\n• Michaels Companies Inc. MIK, +6.26% gave guidance ahead of expectations but that didn’t take into account the impact of the coronavirus. Mark Cosby, Michaels CEO, said the company doesn’t expect “material supply chain disruptions” in the first quarter but sales in certain categories are slowing.\\n\\n• Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.24% warned that it will not meet guidance for its fiscal third quarter due to COVID-19. Microsoft in late January guided for fiscal third-quarter sales for its More Personal Computing segment of $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion, which “included a wider-than-usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.” While there’s “strong” demand for Windows in line with the company’s expectations, the supply chain “is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. All other components of its Q3 guidance remain unchanged, Microsoft said.\\n\\n• Mondelēz Inc. MDLZ, -0.24% told investors to expect “an impact on both revenue and margins” as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. “I’m quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don’t see at this point,” CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\\n\\n• Nike Inc. NKE, +3.34% has closed about half its stores in China, while the remaining stores are reporting lower-than-expected retail traffic. The athletic-apparel maker said it plans to provide an update about the impact of the virus on its third-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n• Nordstrom Inc. JWN, +9.28% closed its U.S. and Canadian stores, including Nordstrom full-line, Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club clubhouses and Jeffrey, for two weeks. The company’s online business, which accounted for one-third of sales in 2019, will remain in business. The company also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance offered on March 3, which didn’t include the impact of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, +3.39% expects the virus to shave off 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia — that’s 40 total — through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\\n\\n• OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. OSW, -0.57% , which provides on-board spa services to cruises, said in an earnings statement that it expects to lose $5 million in revenue and $2 million in adjusted EBITDA as a result of 141 canceled or modified voyages and lower revenue at its resort spas in Asia.\\n\\n• ON Semiconductor Corp. ON, +9.86% issued a revenue warning for the first quarter, due to the change in business conditions being created by the coronavirus. The Apple supplier now expects revenue to range from $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, compared with prior guidance of $1.355 billion to $1.405 billion, issued on Feb. 3. “We saw soft order trends in China in the weeks following Lunar New Year holidays, but orders have since picked up, and we have not seen any significant cancellations of orders,” CEO Keith Jackson said in a statement.\\n\\n• L’Oréal LRLCY, +4.06% said the impact from the outbreak will be temporary, based on the cosmetics maker’s experience with the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. What is different about this outbreak, however, is L’Oréal’s e-commerce sales of beauty products in China are stronger so far in February than they were this month last year. “This crisis will even strengthen the position of the e-commerce players in China,” CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors at an analyst conference.\\n\\n• Papa John’s International Inc. PZZA, -1.12% said it has closed about 50 franchised stores in China as a result of the outbreak. Although the pizza company said the impact of the store closures isn’t currently material to its earnings, uncertainty about the spread of the virus could “lead to lower sales [and] widespread store closures or delays in our supply chain, which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results.”\\n\\n• PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -0.45% expects the coronavirus to have a negative revenue impact of 1 percentage point for the March quarter and is expecting revenue for the quarter to fall toward the low end of its guidance of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion. “Stronger performance quarter-to-date across our diversified business is partially offsetting this one percentage point negative impact,” PayPal said.\\n\\n• Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.39% expects the outbreak to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant’s second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\\n\\n• PVH Corp. PVH, +10.88% , owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, said that 20% of its global sourcing comes from greater China, which also made up 7% of its 2019 revenue. Most PVH-owned stores in China remain closed. Still, the company reaffirmed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $1.79 for the fourth quarter and at least $9.45 for the full year.\\n\\n• Qorvo Inc. QRVO, +3.01% cut its revenue outlook, citing the estimated impact the coronavirus outbreak is having on the smartphone supply chain. The Apple Inc. supplier said it now expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of about $770 million, which is $50 million below the midpoint of the guidance range provided on Jan. 29 of $800 million to $840 million\\n\\n• Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, +8.02% said fiscal 2020 sales could be hurt by up to $70 million and operating income in Asia could take a $35 million to $45 million hit as a result of the outbreak. Two-thirds of the luxury retailer’s mainland China stores have been closed for a week, and about half of its stores were closed another week.\\n\\nSee:Large wave of new diagnoses said to have harmed confidence in China\\n\\n• Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +3.76% canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries as a result of the virus. The cruise-line operator said it expects an impact of 65 cents per share on its 2020 financial performance. If it has to cancel cruises in Asia through April, doing so would impact the company’s 2020 financial performance by an additional 55 cents a share.\\n\\n• Sabre Corp. SABR, +12.76% said the coronavirus will have a “material impact” on its 2020 results, as the outbreak has weighed on travel bookings so far this year. The company said the estimated impact for the first quarter of earnings per share of 14 cents to 23 cents and for revenue of $100 million to $150 million.\\n\\n• Sanderson Farms Inc. SAFM, -6.15% said the outbreak of African swine fever in China should eventually boost the poultry market in the U.S., but COVID-19 is now disrupting markets in China, depressing demand, hurting shipping and supply chain logistics and slowing China’s economic growth rate. The chicken meat producer said the Chinese lifting of the ban on chicken from the U.S. had led to orders for about 18 million pounds of chicken products.\\n\\n• Skechers USA Inc. SKX, +5.89% said the impact of COVID-19 had worsened since it last updated investors when it reported earnings on Feb. 6. Skechers offered guidance at that time for first-quarter sales of $1.400 billion to $1.425 billion, and earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents. “Things definitely have deteriorated to a degree,” CFO John Vandemore told investors at a UBS conference. He also said the big change is now coming in European countries that have experienced clusters of the illness, with Italy closing schools and universities.\\n\\n• Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, +5.62% CEO Gary Kelly told employees that he will take a 10% pay cut, as the company faces the worst downturn in decades as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\n• Spirit Airlines Inc. SAVE, +19.46% told investors they shouldn’t rely on its 2020 financial guidance given the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The discount air carrier said at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference that it has seen “significant pressure” on fares since the end of February and “modest” pressure on load factor.\\n\\n• Stanley Black & Decker Inc. SWK, +5.20% expects the outbreak to “cause some pressure for us in March and April from a revenue perspective,” according to remarks made by CFO Donald Allan at an investor conference. The company generates about $250 million in annual revenue in China and runs 10 plants there, which are operating at about 50% to 60% capacity, as of last week.\\n\\n• Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +2.31% , the Seattle-based coffee chain, said it was already “showing early signs of recovery” in China and that U.S. sales are still strong despite the coronavirus. “To date, there are no perceptible signs of COVID-19 impact on our U.S. business, which accounted for approximately 65% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020,” the coffee chain said in a financial filing. The company’s shareholder meeting will be “virtual only” this year due to the coronavirus.\\n\\n• TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, +7.73% said it may see a low-single-digit percentage impact on its financial results. “We do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we’re not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business,” CEO Stephen Kaufer told analysts.\\n\\n• Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, -3.84% has restarted some operations in China, but CEO Noel White said the company will face short-term impacts from the outbreak, even if the fallout eventually helps support government efforts in China to “decrease” the number of wet markets. Researchers believe that the virus, common to bats, may have been transmitted to humans via another animal sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan. “We’ll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China,” White said. “The combination of [African swine fever] and coronavirus would expedite that transition.”\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +9.27% expects to lose between $50 million and $60 million in sales to the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +12.50% rescinded its annual revenue guidance for 2020, saying the outbreak is too unpredictable to ensure that the forecast it issued two months ago will hold up. The airline will cut flight capacity by 10% domestically and 20% internationally in April due to the coronavirus outbreak. Executives Oscar Munoz and Scott Kirby will forego their base salaries, effective immediately through June 30, and the company has withdrawn its first-quarter guidance. Net bookings to Asia and Europe are down 100%; the company’s “dire scenario planning assumption” is that revenue will be down 70% in April and May. In comparison, demand was down 40% for the two months following 9/11. Kirby said he expects to recover demand within 18 months.\\n\\n• Urban Outfitters Inc.’s URBN, +9.17% store traffic and sales fell over the past week in cities including Milan and Seattle where the coronavirus is having a heavy impact. Other cities have been affected as well. The company, which also operates Anthropologie and Free People, said it can’t forecast how the company will be impacted in the first quarter because of the uncertainty around the outbreak.\\n\\n• Vail Resorts Inc. MTN, +2.74% said earnings and revenue were lower than analysts expected and rescinded its annual guidance as it sees business declining. “In the week ended March 8, 2020, we saw a marked negative change in performance from the prior week, with destination skier visits modestly below expectations,” Chief Executive Rob Katz said in a news release. “We expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in upcoming weeks.”\\n\\n• VF Corp. VFC, +7.83% , which owns the sneaker brand Vans, has closed 60% of its owned and partner stores in China. The shops that have remained open are reporting “significant” declines in retail traffic.\\n\\n• ViacomCBS Inc. VIAC, +4.02% is delaying the release of the “Sonic the Hedgehog” move in some Asian markets because of the outbreak, while MGM and Universal Studios said Wednesday that “No Time to Die,” the release of the next iteration of the James Bond movies, will be postponed until November.\\n\\n• Visa Inc. expects the outbreak to result in fiscal second-quarter revenue that is about 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points lower than the previously issued range of “low double-digit net revenue growth in constant dollars” that Visa gave with its latest earnings report in January. The company said the virus was having a “significant impact” on Asia-related travel that has caused a “sharp slowdown of our cross-border business” for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.37% anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. “Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,” Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\\n\\n• Walt Disney Co. DIS, +2.88% said if its shuttered Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks remain closed for months, it would shave $175 million off operating income in the current quarter. Disney’s movie-studio business could also take a hit, as cinemas are closed in China and Disney is preparing to launch the live-action “Mulan” reboot in March.\\n\\n• Wolverine World Wide Inc. WWW, +4.49% provided a downbeat full-year outlook, citing the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its shoe brands, which include Hush Puppies, Sperry, and Stride Rite. The company reported a net loss of $900,000, or 1 cent a share, in the latest quarter, after earnings of $39.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\n• Workday Inc. WDAY, +1.61% said it has pulled the plug on an internal sales conference in Orlando, Fla., set for next week that was expected to draw more than 3,000 people. The decision was made because of the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Xenia Hotels & Resorts Inc. XHR, +4.92% withdrew the 2020 guidance provided in late February, citing increased uncertainty regarding the financial impact resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. The real-estate investment trust that invests in luxury hotels said group cancellations have increased to $15 million of revenue since Feb. 24, while transient cancellations have increased significantly.\\n\\n• Yum China Holdings Inc. YUMC, +3.09% , which operates fast-food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For those that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing “significant interruption,” said Yum China Holdings CEO Joey Wat. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\\n\\n• Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. ZBH, +1.47% said the number of elective procedures in China, which makes up about 5% of global revenue, fell by up to 90% in February, and CFO Suketu Upadhyay expects that to continue through March “at a minimum.” There are also now early signs that procedures are slowing down in South Korea.\\n\\n• Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, +7.58% , which has seen its stock jump as more employers talk about having their workers work from home to prevent the spread of the virus, said all employees at its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., have been told to work from home. “We have definitely seen an uptick in usage, but a lot of that is on the free side,” Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg said during an earnings call.\\n\\nDon’t miss: Here are vulnerable parts of the U.S. economy that coronavirus may infect',\n",

       "   'text': 'In the long-run, does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor?\\n\\nIndeed, even among those investors who don\\'t try to consistently time the markets, many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically. It\\'s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market.\\n\\nGiving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement. For example, many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks to correct, only see the latter achieve new highs, move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels: Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (AACAY), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI), Apple Inc. (AAPL), ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN)\\n\\nFear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react, rather than anticipate market moves.\\n\\nFruitful market timing requires three key parts: 1) A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks (or securities, gold or different kinds of investments). 2) The capacity to act on the sign accurately. 3) The control to follow up on it.\\n\\nMarket timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly. However, there is a less common, rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time.\\n\\nRule 1: Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose-lose situation.\\n\\nForget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit, regardless of whether your calls are spot-on or way off-base.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRule 2: Don\\'t sell during minor crashes - instead, have the patience to weather the storm, or even better, milk the opportunity to buy low.\\n\\nWarren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard. He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul.\\n\\nThere is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10% market correction. If the companies you own are established and successful, they are likely to return to their pre - crash price before long, making holding on the wisest decision. Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn, essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice, \\'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\\'\\n\\nA Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets\\n\\nIt\\'s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market. But, think about this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Indeed, even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn\\'t justify the efforts - and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it, market timing shouldn\\'t be your exclusive methodology for investing, particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg.\\n\\nActively trading for alpha, outsized, short - term gains through market timing and other high - risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets, but for your longer - term retirement assets, a \"risk -adjusted focused\" investment solution generally makes more sense.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to learn how to \\'super-charge\\' your retirement assets, get our free report:\\n\\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.

However, the Macau government said Monday that it is also considering implementing body-temperature checks at casino entrances, requiring employees and customers to wear masks, and setting apart gaming tables by an unspecified distance.\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC MDT, -0.15% told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc.

There are also earnings previews for select companies. Please check back often.

However, companies featured in \"Earnings Spotlights\" have officially announced their earnings dates.)\\n\\nEarnings Calendar Highlights\\n\\nMONDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE), Baidu (BIDU), Bilibili (BILI), iQIYI (IQ), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), Trivago (TRVG)\\n\\nTUESDAY\\n\\nEarnings Spotlight: Walmart (WMT, $125.94) - Walmart\\'s positioning as one of the premier \"essential\" retailers during the COVID-19 outbreak has earned it 6% year-to-date gains in a year that the broader blue-chip indices are down by double digits. And it should be no surprise that analysts expect a decent report when Walmart announces quarterly earnings ahead of the May 19 bell. Analysts are looking for a 5.2% improvement in revenues to $130.31 billion, which should fuel a 3.5% bump in profits to $1.17 per share. The question for shareholders is: What does WMT have left in the tank? While Wall Street is still broadly bullish on the name - the stock racked up 17 Buy ratings over the past quarter, versus just six Holds - RBC Capital analyst Scot Ciccarelli (Sector Perform, equivalent of Hold) sees \"limited\" upside. While the company has sales momentum and can be a prime recession stock, Ciccarelli says higher labor and cleaning costs, as well as a frothy valuation, could keep a lid on the stock.\\n\\nEarnings Spotlight: Home Depot (HD, $239.33) - Home Depot is another major name reporting in what will be a big week for retailers. Like Walmart, Home Depot has been deemed \"essential,\" and is widely expected to benefit from an uptick in DIY projects as many people are confined to their homes - that\\'s largely why investors have bid shares up nearly 10% year-to-date. Wells Fargo\\'s Zachary Fadem (Overweight, equivalent of Buy) recently raised his price target on shares from $215 to $260, believing the company will top analyst estimates in its Tuesday morning report, and writing that the company deserves its premium valuation. Wall Street analysts are looking for 3.4% year-over-year revenue growth to $27.28 billion, but a marginal decline in profits to $2.26 per share.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOther Noteworthy Reports: Advance Auto Parts (AAP), Netease (NTES), Sina (SINA), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Weibo (WB)\\n\\nWEDNESDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Analog Devices (ADI), Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories (RDY), Expedia Group (EXPE), Huya (HUYA), L Brands (LB), Lowe\\'s (LOW), McKesson (MCK), Shoe Carnival (SCVL), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Target (TGT), VEREIT (VER), ZTO Express (ZTO)\\n\\nTHURSDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Agilent Technologies (A), Apollo Investment (AINV), Best Buy (BBY), BJ\\'s Wholesale Club (BJ), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL), Intuit (INTU), Nvidia (NVDA), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Ross Stores (ROST), SeaDrill (SDRL), Splunk (SPLK), Teekay Corp.

BABA shares are only slightly outperforming the Chinese market, at 4% losses versus about 6% for the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI). Nonetheless, it\\'s still a wildly popular pick in the analyst community, where 13 pros have rattled off Buy-equivalent ratings over the past three months, with no opposition. CLSA\\'s Elinor Leung (Buy) notes that Alibaba\\'s recovery isn\\'t even across the board - staples sales have grown, consumer electronics have been resilient, but discretionary products are slow to bounce back. She says Alibaba\\'s quarter ended March \"was a tough quarter.\" On average, analysts expect an 11.9% jump in revenues to $15.20 billion, but a 30.4% drop in earnings to 87 cents per share.\\n\\nOther Noteworthy Reports: Buckle (BKE), Deere (DE), Foot Locker (FL)\\n\\nReporting schedules provided by Briefing.com and company websites.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nThe most sustainable companies outside the U.S. outperformed a key benchmark for international stocks, mirroring the strength of the companies in Barron’s third annual ranking of the 100 most environmentally and socially responsible businesses in this country.\\n\\nThe 20 companies in the ranking, compiled by Calvert Research & Management, a unit of Eaton Vance (ticker: EV), returned 23.6% for 2019, compared with the 22% return for the MSCI EAFE benchmark, which is much broader and contains 917 companies.\\n\\nTopping the list of non-U.S. companies is Australia’s Brambles (BXB.Australia), which supplies shipping pallets all over the world, and Ireland-based consulting company Accenture (ACN), at No. 2. The two switched places from 2018.\\n\\nBrambles helps customers cut waste and emissions, partly by reusing packaging. Nearly all its wood is sustainably sourced, while 60% of its electricity is from renewables. Brambles shares are “favorably” positioned, Morgan Stanley recently said, because the company has a substantial stock buyback program and limited exposure to Asia, where coronavirus fears are hurting sentiment.\\n\\nAccenture, meanwhile, has “lots of positives from an employee standpoint,” partly because of a strong retraining program that helps transfer workers displaced by artificial intelligence and automation, says Calvert analyst Chris Madden. The company also has done a good job avoiding assignments with clients with poor ethical profiles, says Bruno Bertocci, head of sustainable equities at UBS Asset Management.\\n\\nSustainable Non-US Companies Outperform Source: Calvert Research & Management; Bloomberg\\n\\nThe ranking also contains a number of hospitality companies, such as France’s Accor (AC.France), and Britain’s Whitbread (WTB.UK). “They’ve been reducing their water and energy footprints,” says Calvert’s Madden.\\n\\nAs a group, the companies generally had higher environmental, social, and governance scores, as determined by Calvert, than the U.S. companies. For example, the weighted ESG score for Brambles is 81, while Accenture’s is 80. Seven companies on the list had weighted scores of 77 and 76, matching or beating Agilent (A), the top U.S. company, with a 76.\\n\\n“The scores tend to skew a little higher internationally,” says Madden, partly because of a broader historical recognition in Europe of the needs of stakeholders aside from shareholders. In addition, “regulatory heft in Europe is put behind a lot of environmental and social issues,” he says. Six of the companies are from the U.K., and five from France.\\n\\nDeveloped-market companies outside the U.S. have historically had better disclosure, says UBS’s Bertocci, but the gap between the U.S. and Europe has narrowed so that for the largest companies, “it’s pretty much nonexistent at this point.” Adoption of global disclosure recommendations such as those from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures have helped to diminish the differential.\\n\\nSustainability is directly connected to profitability and thus to stock-price performance. “These issues drive demand for company products, drive operational efficiency within companies, and build productivity across the workforce, all key factors to the competitiveness of a company and its ability to produce a high return on invested capital,” says John Streur, CEO of Calvert.\\n\\nAs a group, the companies are hardly cheap, although their yields are appealing. Collectively, the 20 companies in our ranking have a forward price/earnings ratio of 19.1 times, a P/E to growth rate of 14.1, and a dividend yield of 4.1%. By contrast, the EAFE index has a forward P/E of 15.2 times, a P/E to growth rate of 4.4, and a yield of 3.3%.\\n\\nTo create the Barron’s list of 20 overseas stocks, Calvert started with the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies internationally by market value, ranking them by how they performed for shareholders, employees, customers, community, and the planet. It looked at more than 230 performance indicators that address ESG issues, such as workplace diversity, data security, and greenhouse-gas emissions.\\n\\nBased on the indicators, Calvert assigned a score of zero to 100 in each stakeholder category. Then, it created a weighted average of the categories for each company, based on how financially material each category was for its industry peer group.\\n\\nA more detailed description of the methodology is available at this link.\\n\\nWrite to Leslie P.

Let\\'s check out how the charts have been flowing.\\n\\nIn this daily bar chart of A, below, we can see a May/August double-bottom in price and the subsequent rally to a high last month. Prices pulled back to test the rising 50-day moving average line and trading volume did not expand which a good pattern to observe. Prices are now back above the rising 50-day line and the bullish 200-day line is at a comfortable distance below the price of A. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been going up from its slightly lower low in August. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line but narrowing towards a potential go-long signal.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices broke out on the upside of a long sideways to rising consolidation pattern. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has broken out on the upside of its long sideways pattern and tells us that aggressive buying has been taking place. The MACD oscillator on this longer time frame is bullish, but we could see a crossover to the downside depending on how weak price get in the short-run.\\n\\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of A, below, we used daily price data and here the chart shows that A has reached (and exceeded) a price target.\\n\\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of A, below, we used weekly price data and here a potential price target of $97 is indicated.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: Traders could approach the long side of A at current levels risking a close below $82.

       "   'title': \"Keysight Technologies' Nersesian Reveals Key To Standalone Success\",\n",
       "   'text': 'Ron Nersesian faced a huge challenge when he took over as Keysight Technologies CEO.\\n\\nX\\n\\nFor years, the electronic test-and-measurement company sat inside the original Hewlett-Packard (HPQ). But HP decided to focus on computers and printers in 1999. And it spun off its measurement division as Agilent Technologies (A). Keysight Technologies (KEYS) was then carved out from Agilent as an IPO in 2014.\\n\\nThat\\'s when Nersesian took the helm. And his task was big: Turn a Santa Rosa, Calif.-based former unit into a powerhouse of its own.\\n\\nKeysight Technologies CEO: Invest Early In Trends\\n\\nKeysight needed its own identity. For years, its stable profits funneled to other businesses that were growing. Nersesian knew that, to grow, he\\'d need to take a risk.\\n\\n\"We had been the profit engine to fund (our parent companies\\') acquisitions for three decades,\" Nersesian told Investor\\'s Business Daily. Still, Keysight held its industry edge despite relatively flat revenue and low investment in research and development.\\n\\nAfter the split from Agilent, some investors told Nersesian to slash R&D spending. \"I was advised by some investors to cut R&D in half ... since we would never be a growth company,\" Nersesian said. He raised R&D spending instead. \"(We) started investing in 5G wireless and other trends very early to be able to deliver great overall growth.\"\\n\\nAnd the bet paid off. Keysight remains the global leader in wireless test and measurement. It holds over 1,700 patents and its 32,000 customers include the top 25 tech companies.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s a profitable growth company now, too. Revenue is seen hitting nearly $4.6 billion this fiscal year, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. That\\'s up 59% from $2.9 billion in 2014. And adjusted net income is on pace to hit $991 million, nearly double from $502 million in 2014.\\n\\nInvestors scored, too. Keysight\\'s shares are up 250% from their first closing price in October 2014. The S&P 500 is up less than 70% during that time.\\n\\nLeverage Your Experience\\n\\nNersesian, 60, was born in New York City. And he grew up in Livingston, N.J. He earned his electrical engineering B.S. at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., in 1982. And 10 years later he added an MBA from New York University.\\n\\nEarly in his career, in 1982, Nersesian joined what is now DXC Technology (DXC). His first job? A satellite communications systems engineer. And two years later, he joined HP\\'s test-and-measurement unit. He rose to marketing manager, for what is now its power product division.\\n\\nThe progression of jobs shaped Nersesian\\'s career. \"In my initial time at HP, I learned to have high expectations about increasing the growth rate and profitability,\" of the company, Nersesian said.\\n\\nLearn To Grow Sales And Profits\\n\\nNersesian left HP in 1996 to join what is now Teledyne Technologies (TDY). The company makes oscilloscopes and other test equipment. He started as vice president of marketing. And he rose to chief administrative officer by the time he left in 2002.\\n\\nAnd \"I learned that smaller companies need to be really creative ... and fight for every sale,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We significantly grew the oscilloscope business during my term,\" he recalled. \"And I thought about how in larger corporations, you often have guiderails on how aggressive you can be. I imagined what a phenomenal job one could do by applying the resources of a big company in a creative way.\"\\n\\nFollow Opportunity Where It Arises\\n\\nHP\\'s spinoff of Agilent turned into an opportunity. The company asked Nerseian to come back as vice president of design validation in Colorado Springs, Colo. After increasing its top and bottom lines there by 2005, he went to California to run the wireless business unit. There, he doubled its revenues.\\n\\nIn 2009, Nersesian rose to president of the electronic measurement group. He changed its business model and increased profits by a wide margin again. And in 2011, Agilent tapped Nersesian as president and COO. He took the CEO title when Keysight launched as a separate company.\\n\\nAlly With Investors Who Share Your Vision\\n\\nMaking tough decisions, especially financial bets, shows you who your allies are.\\n\\n\"When we announced we were going to increase R&D investment, that drove away short-term investors and hedge funds,\" Nersesian said. \"We procured a new base interested in value, with later growth.\"\\n\\nAnd lining up allies is important, Nersesian says. That gives you the time to make hard decisions, which might not pay off right away.\\n\\nKeysight\\'s revenue and profit increased largely due to a bold reorganization of the company, he says. Keysight shifted its focus from products to industries. It organized into units to address specific needs, be it communications, electronic-industrial or network solutions. Previously, customers dealt with as many as a dozen groups to get answers.\\n\\nGive Managers Control\\n\\nNersesian learned how frustrating being buried in a big company can be. He\\'s found a way to counteract that as the Keysight Technologies CEO.\\n\\nPresidents of each Keysight unit get resources they need. They are held accountable for finding solutions that satisfy customers. That pushes managers to understand customers\\' needs and keep up with technology shifts, says Nersesian.\\n\\nIt also helps avoid costly mistakes. Helping other companies deliver new products that don\\'t need patches and recalls when launched boosts the bottom line. The global number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices alone is expected to increase from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 50 billion next year, generating $14 trillion in sales. By 2028, Nersesian predicts, nearly everything will be connected.\\n\\nHis managers are ready.\\n\\nValue Great Employees\\n\\nNersesian\\'s approach requires top-notch employees ready to take charge. Finding and keeping such employees is tough. Much bigger and richer companies try to poach employees.\\n\\nNersesian sees employee relations as a top job for the CEO. \"Many say Keysight is the best place they\\'ve ever worked, which is a high bar when you consider so many of us came from HP,\" Nersesian said.\\n\\nThe bonus structure rewards performance. And the added responsibility makes the work interesting. \"We have a long length of service. While good pay and benefits are essential, employees are passionate about what they do,\" Nersesian says. \"We are accelerating innovation in cutting-edge technologies that will connect and secure the world.\"\\n\\nShow Employees Are Key\\n\\nA major test of employee loyalty came with the wildfire that devastated Santa Rosa, Calif., area in October 2017. Nersesian ordered an evacuation as flames approached the company\\'s headquarters, located there.\\n\\nKeysight discovered many of its 1,503 local employees were unreachable. Many listed home phones for their emergency contact or cellphones left behind in the rush to escape. By the end of the first day, 700 employees could not be located. By the end of the week, all were.\\n\\nThe company gave each of the 119 employees who lost homes a $10,000 gift to help while they waited for insurance compensation. The Keysight Technologies CEO opened resource centers to provide supplies and help locate temporary places to live. Emotional counselors and legal advisors were brought in.\\n\\nKnow Profits Come From A Winning Plan\\n\\nProfit follows a solid and sustainable plan, Nersesian says.\\n\\n\"We could have printed more profits, but that\\'s not what we are about when it comes to how we should treat those who have given decades of their lives to this business,\" said Nersesian. \"People worked overtime and we delivered tremendous results during the recovery, which is still ongoing. I heard from many that they never want to work for another company the rest of their lives.\"\\n\\nEmployees remember when companies treat them well in time of crisis. \"I\\'ve worked with Ron since 2002 at both Agilent and Keysight. And from the beginning I\\'ve learned a lot from him,\" said Jay Alexander, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Keysight.\\n\\n\"He taught us how to work ... so that we increased revenue, profit, and market share,\" Alexander said. \"He has taught us about strategic thinking and courageous leadership in overcoming enormous challenges.\"\\n\\nKeysight Technologies CEO Nersesian\\'s Keys\\n\\nPresident and CEO of Keysight Technologies, a world leader in electronic test-and-measurement equipment and software.\\n\\nOvercame: Lack of sales growth and innovation while buried in HP.\\n\\nLesson: To aim for perfection, make sure you align practices with the vision and goals.\\n\\n\"When faced with big decisions, do so quickly, or your competitors will take your business.\"\\n\\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nGrand Canyon Education\\'s Brian Mueller Uses Coaching Skills To Lead\\n\\nYou\\'re Just Steps Away From A Winning Mindset\\n\\nInspirational Quotes: John Naisbitt, Bill Cowher, Robin Roberts And Others\\n\\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\\n\\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest',\n",

We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It\\'s not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) was in 35 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of March. A investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest in recent months. There were 46 hedge funds in our database with A positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that A isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds\\' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 51 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren\\'t comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.\\n\\n[caption id=\"attachment_607931\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"] Bill Ackman of Pershing Square[/caption]\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea.

       "   'text': 'Agilent Technologies A recently announced its intention to offer a series of senior notes. The interest rate, principal amount, maturity date and other terms of the notes are yet to be determined. The offering is subject to market and other conditions.\\n\\nBofA Securities, Mizuho Securities USA LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for this purpose.

Price and Consensus\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nCash Position\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal second-quarter 2020, Agilent’s cash and short-term investments totaled $1.32 billion compared with $1.23 billion at prior quarter-end. Long-term debt was $1.8 billion, flat sequentially.\\n\\nDuring the recently reported quarter, operating cash flow was $313 million. Agilent paid $55 million in dividends and repurchased 1.66 million shares for $126 million.\\n\\nIn our view, the stock offering is expected to boost financial flexibility and help the company meet financial obligations in an efficient way. Moreover, it provides ample scope to deploy capital for long-term growth opportunities and rewarding higher returns to stockholders.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAgilent’s expanding product portfolio, end-market strength and robust performance in key markets are growth drivers. Moreover, the company’s decision to divest/wind up underperforming businesses is beneficial for core operations.\\n\\nRecently, Agilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to drive top-line growth. Also, growth of the API business is a catalyst.\\n\\nIts focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative high-margin product launches is another positive.\\n\\nHowever, increasing competition and higher expenses are making margin expansion difficult for the company.\\n\\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\\n\\nAgilent currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Wayfair Inc. W, eBay EBAY and Inphi Corporation IPHI. While Wayfair sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both eBay and Inphi carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\n\\nLong-term earnings growth for Wayfair, eBay, and Inphi is currently projected at 23%, 12.4% and 37.7%, respectively.\\n\\n5 Stocks to Soar Past the Pandemic:In addition to the companies you learned about above, we invite you to learn about 5 cutting-edge stocks that could skyrocket from the exponential increase in demand for “stay at home” technologies.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

And they upped a stake of Restaurant Brands International QSR, -1.29% QSR, -1.29% , owner of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s, by more than 50%. Pershing Square said as budget-conscious consumers trade down due to the pandemic, they’ll head to cheaper eateries like those.\\n\\nPershing is sticking to fast-food chain Chipotle CMG, -0.77% for its “fortress balance sheet” and zero debt. Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, -3.13% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +0.26% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, -1.05% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +3.64% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis. On the upside, people still value homeownership now, said Ackman.\\n\\nThe chart\\n\\nThis Goldman Sachs chart shows the recovering, but bumpy trajectory for China consumer activity — includes hotels, movie, theater, retail sales, airline seat miles — post pandemic, versus the U.S., where it is obviously deeply depressed.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing. Americans are expected to move more freely over the coming long Memorial Day holiday weekend that signals the start of summer.\\n\\nRead now: States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: More beaches, casinos open ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend\\n\\nIt also comes as an ABC News/Ispos poll found that just 39% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, the lowest reading for the president since the poll started to track sentiment in March.\\n\\nA Fox News poll published on Thursday found just 44% of those polled approve of Trump’s performance, down from 49% in April. The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co. F, +6.13% plant that has switched production to make ventilators and masks. Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic. They have been regularly touted by President Donald Trump, who said this week that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine. A number of clinical trials are underway evaluating the medications as both a treatment or a prophylactic for those at high-risk of contracting the virus.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThere are now 5.24 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and at least 338,762 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.

NVDA, +0.01% posting consensus-beating profit and sales as data-center sales topped $1 billion for the first time. The chip giant’s two largest segments, chips for gaming and chips for data centers, showed no signs of damage from the pandemic, after emerging from a year of struggle at the end of 2019. Data-center operators continue to push new chips into their servers to increase machine-learning capabilities for cloud customers and their own usage, while videogames have enjoyed a strong surge amid shelter-in-place requirements.\\n\\nRead:Business in the Age of COVID-19: Nvidia should dodge massive coronavirus effects\\n\\nRelated:It’s official: Nvidia is not just a gaming company anymore\\n\\nThere was less cheery news for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.

A.B. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, echoing the concerns of other analysts on the conference call, expressed wariness over what he called another “significant multi-year effort” by HPE to slash costs.

BABA, -0.26% , which offered a first look at how China is faring as it comes out of lockdown.\\n\\nElsewhere, companies continued to issue debt and equity, and to update investors and customers on their reopening plans.\\n\\nRead: ‘The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating’: Americans brace for another coronavirus outbreak in the fall\\n\\nHere are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Agilent Technologies Inc. A, +0.71% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +8.04% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +2.24% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.08% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -1.17% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +1.19% UAA, +1.06% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our \"building and buying\" strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.58 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 22.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this scientific instrument maker would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering no surprise.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\\n\\nAgilent, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.24 billion for the quarter ended April 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nAgilent shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -8%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Agilent?\\n\\nWhile Agilent has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $1.20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.95 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "   'text': \"Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio), the leader of Pershing Square Capital Management, released his first-quarter portfolio last week.\\n\\nThe guru's New York-based hedge fund is known for taking large positions in a handful of underperforming companies and pushing for change in order to unlock value for shareholders. One of Ackman's most well-known activist targets in recent years, which did not end well for him, was Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAckman's most notable trades for the three months ended March 31 included new positions in Blackstone Group Inc. (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK), as well as significant increases in his holdings of Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) and The Howard Hughes Corp. (NYSE:HHC). He also curbed his stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG) by 32.66%.\\n\\nBlackstone Group\\n\\nThe activist guru invested in 548,526 shares of Blackstone, allocating 0.38% of the equity portfolio to the position. The stock traded for an average price of $55.53 per share during the quarter.\\n\\nThe New York-based investment management company has a $63.18 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $52.86 on Wednesday with a price-earnings ratio of 72.41, a price-book ratio of 6.64 and a price-sales ratio of 19.24.\\n\\nThe Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overpriced. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 1 out of 10 also supports overvaluation since the price-earnings and price-sales ratios are near multiyear highs.\\n\\nf36bfbf8c4cc9efe5a3cf125c5531bbe.png More\\n\\nGuruFocus rated Blackstone's financial strength 3 out of 10. As a result of issuing approximately $8.3 billion in new long-term debt over the past three years, it has poor interest coverage.\\n\\nThe company's profitability did not fare much better, scoring a 4 out of 10 rating on the back of a net margin and return on equity that outperform slightly over half of its competitors. Despite recording a slowdown in revenue per share growth over the past 12 months, Blackstone also has a business predictability rank of one out of five stars. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return, on average, 1.1% per annum over a 10-year period.\\n\\nOf the gurus invested in Blackstone, Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) has the largest position with 0.10% of its outstanding shares. Other top guru shareholders include Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio), Julian Robertson (Trades, Portfolio), Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio), John Rogers (Trades, Portfolio), Alan Fournier (Trades, Portfolio), Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio), Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, David Rolfe (Trades, Portfolio), Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and Mairs and Power (Trades, Portfolio).\\n\\nPark Hotels & Resorts\\n\\nAckman picked up 677,888 shares of Park Hotels & Resorts, dedicating 0.08% of the equity portfolio to the holding. Shares traded for an average price of $19.07 each during the quarter.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Tysons, Virginia, the real estate investment trust, which focuses on hotel properties, has a market cap of $2.14 billion; its shares were trading around $9.08 on Wednesday with a price-book ratio of 0.39 and a price-sales ratio of 0.73.\\n\\nAccording to the price chart, the stock is trading above its median price-sales value but below its median price-book ratio.\\n\\ne6e60d50115482e0a1a4eab922ceec3c.png More\\n\\nPark's financial strength was rated 4 out of 10 on the back of low interest coverage and an Altman Z-Score of 0.66, which warns the company could be in danger of going bankrupt. The weighted average cost of capital also exceeds the return on invested capital, suggesting poor profitability.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

       "   'text': 'After several years of lackluster returns, Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio) is having a blowout 2020. This comes off the back of a fantastic year in 2019 as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to its December update, Ackman\\'s hedge fund, Pershing Square Holdings, gained 4.5% in December, bringing its 2019 net performance to 58.1%.\\n\\nAckman\\'s run of good luck has continued into 2020. As of the beginning of this month, Pershing Square was up more than 17%. That\\'s compared to a double-digit decline for the S&P 500 over the same period.\\n\\nBig payoff\\n\\nAckman hit the headlines back in March when it was revealed that he\\'d made a 100-fold return on a hedging bet.\\n\\nPershing Square bought far out of the money protection against investment-grade and high-yield bond indexes, spending about $27 million for this protection. Ackman and his team bet that if volatility exploded, credit spreads would widen dramatically, putting what has been described as their \"ultra-convex bets\" in the money and generating a huge payoff.\\n\\nThat\\'s just what happened. Ackman reportedly booked a $2.6 billion gain on the trade when volatility spiked in March.\\n\\nThis gave the hedge fund manager a considerable war chest to invest in the market when stock prices for many companies had reached multi-year lows. Ackman used this cash to increase holdings in some of his favorite positions while buying new stakes in others.\\n\\nAckman\\'s buys\\n\\nAccording to Pershing Square\\'s latest 13F filing, the activist hedge fund manager nearly doubled his position in home improvement retailer Lowe\\'s Cos (NYSE:LOW) during the first quarter. The position now accounts for 16% of his portfolio and was worth just over $1 billion at the end of March.\\n\\nAckman first invested in Lowe\\'s back in 2018. Writing in his 2018 annual shareholder letter, the activist investor said that he was attracted to the company due to its ambitions to increase profit margins to 12% over the medium-term from 9.2%. The company aims to improve operations to a similar caliber as that of peer Home Depot (NYSE:HD), which has margins of nearly 15%.\\n\\nAckman also used his windfall to increase Pershing Square\\'s stake in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B). Commenting on the position in 2019, the hedge fund manager said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The catalyst for our current investment in Berkshire is our view that the company is currently trading at one of the widest discounts to its intrinsic value in many years, at a time when we expect the operating performance of its subsidiaries to improve as a result of certain managerial and organizational changes at the company.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the stock has only continued to fall in 2020, it seems reasonable to speculate that Ackman believes the company is substantially more undervalued today than it was last year.\\n\\nAckman also substantially increased his position in Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A). The fund increased the holding by nearly 300% to just over 12.6 million shares. It now has a 14% portfolio weight.\\n\\nHe also increased his position in Howard Hughes Corp (NYSE:HHC) by 455%. The position is now 12.2 million shares, worth just over $616 million.\\n\\nTwo additions to the portfolio in the quarter were The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK). These are currently quite small positions in the portfolio. They make up just 0.4% and 0.8% of the equity portfolio, respectively. It\\'ll be interesting to see if the hedge fund manager continues to acquire shares in these companies over the next few months. He traditionally owns a concentrated portfolio of investments, with an average portfolio weight of 10%.\\n\\nDisclosure: The author owns shares in Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\nRead more here:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered in-line results.\\n\\nThe stock outperformed earnings estimates twice, matched once and missed on another occasion in the last four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 1.9%.\\n\\nTrend in Estimate Revision\\n\\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has declined 7.9% to 58 cents per share over the past 30 days. This indicates a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying a decline of 4.97% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business. Also, growth of the API business should have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative product launches is expected to have aided its performance.\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Agilent this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

       "   'title': 'Can Amazon Solve the Covid-19 Testing Challenge?',\n",
       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nAmazon. com has successfully invaded many different businesses—but Covid-19 testing? The company said during its recent earnings call that it expects to spend $4 billion or more in the second quarter responding to the pandemic. Among other things, it is spending “hundreds of millions to develop our own Covid-19 testing capabilities.”\\n\\nThis news has Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wondering if Amazon might evolve into a major Covid-19 testing player. “We believe the goal is to create Covid-19 testing stations that Amazon employees can pass through on a daily basis,” Nowak writes in a note. “Amazon expects to spend $1 billion on this initiative between April and the end of 2020.”\\n\\nNowak believes Amazon will work on a rapid saliva test. He’s upbeat, despite many unmet promises around testing and Amazon’s lack of experience. He ticks off three challenges, which, he says, play to its strengths. One is supply chain. “The tests will need to be produced in massive quantities and manufacturing capacity built quickly,” he writes. The second is optimization of a test likely to struggle with efficiency and accuracy. The third is capital; Amazon is flush.\\n\\nWhy would Amazon want to get into testing? Nowak, who has an Overweight rating and a $2,600 target price for the stock, argues that employee and customer safety could become a competitive edge in e-commerce. “The potential public goodwill created through [sharing] this cannot be valued, and in a world where tech regulation is a recurring topic, could be a game changer,” he writes.\\n\\nAmazon itself is playing things down. “We’re not sure how far we will get in the relevant time frame, but we think it’s worth trying,” Amazon said.\\n\\nThis Week\\n\\nMonday 5/18\\n\\nThe World Health Organization holds its 73rd World Health Assembly.

Consensus estimates are for a 34.5 reading, up from April’s 30 figure.

       "   'title': 'Earnings Preview: Agilent Technologies (A) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline',\n",
       "   'text': \"The market expects Agilent Technologies (A) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2020. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 21, 2020, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.3%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $1.18 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent?\\n\\nFor Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -18.88%.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

The president has tweeted support for protesters in states including Michigan against restrictions on movement.\\n\\nDemocrats had criticized the plan to wind down the task force, given the U.S. is still seeing increases in case numbers and deaths. Trump acknowledged that reopening would possibly result in more deaths but said, “we can’t sit in the house for the next three years.”\\n\\nA group of young volunteers recruited by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner that was tasked with securing personal protective equipment, or PPE, for frontline workers were told to prioritize tips from political allies and associates of the president, the New York Times reported.\\n\\nCiting emails and documents obtained by their reporters, the paper said few of the leads actually panned out and the volunteers, who had no experience in procurement, were confused and overwhelmed by the task. PPE has been in short supply across the U.S. since the start of the outbreak and is reported to have contributed to infections among health-care and other medical workers.\\n\\nRead: Your genes could determine whether coronavirus puts you in the hospital — and we’re starting to unravel which ones matter\\n\\nIn the U.K., a scientist and top government adviser on the pandemic resigned after he was caught breaking lockdown rules. Prof. Neil Ferguson quit the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment,” as the Guardian reported. The move came after a Daily Telegraph report revealed that Ferguson’s lover had crossed London to visit him at least twice after lockdown measures were implemented.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThe U.K.’s case tally crossed 200,000 on Wednesday and it now has the highest death toll in Europe, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K. has 202,355 cases and 30,150 deaths, putting its death toll ahead of Italy’s, which was an early hot spot. Official numbers from the U.K. have a slightly different tally.\\n\\nThere are 3.71 million cases of COVID-19 globally and 259,695 people have died. At least 1.2 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case toll at 1.21 million and the highest death toll at 71,463.\\n\\nSpain has the highest number of cases in Europe at 219,329 and 25,613 deaths.

Mid-size companies, defined as having 50 to 499 workers, shed 5.3 million jobs, large businesses with 500 employees or more axed 8.9 million jobs.\\n\\nHealth-care jobs were not immune as the pandemic causes a steep decline in treatments for non-virus conditions and the postponement of elective procedures, the data show.

DIS, +1.23% said profit fell more than 90% in its fiscal second quarter, as parks were ordered to close, film production stalled and TV advertising was disrupted. Disney has faced some of the biggest fears from Wall Street about its business during the coronavirus crisis, as its largest units are centered around on-premise interactions that have been shut down during shelter-in-place orders: Theme parks and cruise lines, movies and live sports, for example.\\n\\nAnalysts said the company’s release prompted more questions than answers and criticized the lack of detail on what lies ahead on the earnings call.\\n\\n“Of course we did not expect Disney to opine on timing of openings for Parks, theaters, sports, or content production,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote. “However, we had hoped for better clarity on Parks burn rate when closed, margin profile when opened at reduced capacity, operating rules/implications/parameters for operating in a pre-vaccine world.”\\n\\nFor more, see:Disney earnings leave more questions than answers as COVID-19 pressures theme parks and more\\n\\nThere was better news from videogame makers Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, -0.15% and Electronic Arts Inc. EA, -0.63% , which both reported healthy increases in sales and profit as Americans sheltering in place switched to the virtual world for entertainment.\\n\\nThe companies don’t expect much change: EA predicted profits this quarter would triple from the year before to more than a quarter-billion dollars, while Activision forecast adjusted profit of more than $500 million, a 67% increase.\\n\\nSee also:Videogames are flourishing in the pandemic, and game makers aren’t scared of the future\\n\\nBeyond Meat Inc. BYND, +1.64% said disruption in the meat supply chain as facilities with infected worker are forced to close has been a boost to its lineup of meat substitutes and plant-based products. Beyond Meat reported fiscal first-quarter results that blew past Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 7% in extended trading. Shares have surged 85% since March 18, as retailers request “expedited” deliveries to refill shelves across the country, a company spokesperson said.\\n\\nRival Impossible Foods, which is privately held for now, also reported business that was “full steam ahead.”\\n\\nFor more, read:Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat see spike in demand as coronavirus wreaks havoc on meat supply\\n\\nGeneral Motors Co. GM, +0.31% delivered another surprise with the car maker beating expectations for profit and revenue despite the steep slowdown in car sales during the pandemic.\\n\\nHere’s the latest things companies are saying about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. A, +0.71% has started to reopen stores that were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic in those locations where regulations allow it. “We are optimistic for the future and we’re happy to announce that we have begun to open select stores globally on a rolling basis and will continue to do so in the weeks ahead,” Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said in a regulatory filing. “We will open stores as State and local regulations allow and as we are able to meet the applicable safety and health standards.”\\n\\n• Bunge Ltd. BG, -0.21% reported a surprise first-quarter loss, revenue that fell below expectations and provided a downbeat full-year outlook, saying that while it didn’t experience a significant disruption to its business from the pandemic, it did start to see the negative impact of a change in consumer behavior in its edible oils business in March. “Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,” said Chief Executive Greg Heckman. The company said it expects 2020 EPS to be lower than its original expectation.\\n\\n• CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.47% reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, as its pharmacy and retail business got a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pharmacy businesses benefited from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19-related lockdowns. CVS affirmed its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is above the current FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• General Motors reported first-quarter profit and revenue that fell, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to suspended operations, but beat expectations as U.S. truck sales rose sharply. GM’s U.S. sales fell 7%, driven by the negative effects of the pandemic, but sales of full-size pickups rose 27%, with market share increasing to 41%. Among actions GM has taken to preserve cash during the pandemic include suspension of its dividend and share repurchases, salary cuts and drawing on its credit facilities.\\n\\n• Office Depot Inc. ODP, +1.12% posted first-quarter earnings that blew past estimates. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Office Depot had liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end, its highest net cash position in two years. “Our B2B focus is helping businesses remain operational in the home or at the office, our facilities have largely remained open serving customers with enhanced sanitation and safety protocols, and our e-commerce platform and retail stores are proving to be trusted means for customers to access the critical products and services they need,” Chief Executive Gerry Smith said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 2% in the quarter and e-commerce sales saw a strong jump in demand, he said. The company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance given the uncertainty around the pandemic and is suspending temporarily its share buybacks and dividend payments. Separately, it announced that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to block any party from taking advantage of a falling share price to build a stake in the company.\\n\\n• Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. SPR, +11.13% swung to a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter on revenue that fell less than forecast. The suspension of Boeing Co’s BA, +6.43% production of the 737 MAX plane led to lower margins as given “abnormal” costs associated with the pandemic. Actions the company has taken to preserve liquidity and cut costs amid the 737 MAX groundings and the COVID-19 pandemic include cutting the dividend, suspending share buybacks, deferring repayments of an advance from Boeing and cutting jobs and work schedules. The company will not provide 2020 financial guidance given the continued uncertainties surrounding the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic.\\n\\n• United Airlines Inc. UAL, +16.19% is offering $2.25 billion in senior secured notes in a private offering. The bonds will be offered in two tranches maturing in 2023 and 2025. Proceeds of the deal will be used to repay a $2.0 billion term loan entered into in March and for general corporate purposes. Airlines have been tapping credit lines and government relief plans with most fleets grounded during the pandemic.\\n\\n• Wendy’s Co. WEN, -1.08% reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. Wendy’s had a cash balance of $365 million as of May 3 after fully drawing down its revolving financing facility, reducing its second-quarter dividend and taking other measures due to the pandemic. Nearly all (96%) of Wendy’s restaurants are operating, including 99% in the U.S., with drive-through and delivery only. Wendy’s has said that disruptions to the beef supply chain has put limits on the availability of certain menu items.',\n",

       "   'title': \"Agilent Technologies, Inc. -- Moody's assigns P-2 rating to Agilent's new commercial paper program, affirms Baa2 rating, outlook stable\",\n",
       "   'text': 'NOTE: On May 05, 2020, the press release was corrected as follows: In the debt list, for Agilent Technologies, Inc., under “Outlook action” was changed to “Maintained, Stable.” Revised release follows.\\n\\nNew York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody\\'s Investors Service, (\"Moody\\'s) assigned a P-2 short term rating to Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\'s (\"Agilent\") new $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Concurrently, Moody\\'s affirmed the Baa2 senior unsecured rating. The outlook is stable.\\n\\nThe new $1.0 billion program is supported by Agilent\\'s $1.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring March 2024. Moody\\'s anticipates that Agilent will not issue more under its CP program than is available under its revolving credit facility at any given time, to maintain full back-stop under the program. The credit agreement has no material adverse change clause or material adverse event language related to litigation that would restrict borrowings. The revolver has same-day availability for US borrowings.\\n\\nThe P-2 rating reflects Agilent\\'s excellent liquidity, the company had $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash at January 31, 2020, offset by approximately $675 million of short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt. Agilent has full availability under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The revolver contains financial maintenance covenants. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is currently set at 3.5x, and Moody\\'s expects the company will maintain ample cushion under the leverage covenant.\\n\\nThe rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, the deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The life science tools and services sector has been one of the sectors adversely affected by the shock.\\n\\nMore specifically, Agilent will be impacted by the temporary closure of some research labs, deferral of customers\\' spending on expensive capital equipment and reduced demand from certain economically sensitive industrial and applied end-markets. Further, reduced physician visits and the deferral of healthcare services will also negatively impact demand for certain clinical diagnostics products. Moody\\'s regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, the affirmation of the Baa2 rating reflects Moody\\'s views that Agilent is well positioned at the current Baa2 rating. This reflects the company\\'s strong market positions, diversification both in terms of geographies and end-markets, and conservative financial policies -- as evidenced by leverage that is modest for the Baa2 rating. Further, Agilent has taken steps to adjust its cost base and manage cash conservatively, which includes the suspension of its share buyback program.\\n\\nMoody\\'s took the following rating actions for Agilent Technologies Inc.:\\n\\nAssignments:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\n....Commercial Paper, Assigned P-2\\n\\nRatings affirmed:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nSenior unsecured, at Baa2\\n\\nOutlook action:\\n\\nMaintained, Stable\\n\\nRATINGS RATIONALE\\n\\nThe Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating reflects Agilent\\'s favorable scale, strong competitive positions, attractive growth prospects across key markets, good customer and geographic diversification, moderate leverage, and excellent liquidity. Agilent\\'s ratings also reflect Moody\\'s expectations that the company will maintain conservative financial policies with debt/EBITDA approaching 2.0x in the next 12-18 months. The company\\'s rating is constrained by a relatively high reliance on revenue generated from the sale of expensive equipment used in analytical laboratories. This increases Agilent\\'s sensitivity to economic cycles.\\n\\nReflecting the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the lost business days by the customers of life science companies such as Agilent will temporarily reduce the demand for certain consumable products. Further, some equipment purchases will be delayed. The company\\'s operations, products and services are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for handling, storing and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. An inability to adhere to such standards could result in financial penalties and remediation costs. However, the company applies strict standards for the protection of the environment and occupational health, and high safety standards that help mitigate this risk. Agilent maintains a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. In terms of governance, the company has a track record of maintaining low financial leverage and ample liquidity.\\n\\nThe stable outlook reflects Moody\\'s view that Agilent will maintain its strong market leadership, remain well diversified, and maintain conservative financial policies.\\n\\nFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS\\n\\nRatings could be upgraded if the company is able to generate higher levels of recurring revenue relative to total sales and further strengthens operating performance. Quantitatively, ratings could be upgraded if debt/EBITDA was sustained below 2.0 times.\\n\\nRatings could be downgraded in the event of significant market share erosion, or severe contraction in its key markets. Ratings could also be downgraded in the event of a large debt financed acquisition or shareholder distribution. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if debt to EBITDA was sustained above 3.0 times.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (\"Agilent\") is a leading manufacturer of laboratory equipment and products used in clinical diagnostics. Key product platforms include liquid and gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers, which have applications in a variety of end markets including healthcare, food, chemical and environmental industries. Agilent reports three business segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (\"LSAG\"), Diagnostics and Genomics (\"DGG\") and Agilent CrossLab Group (\"ACG\"). The Life Science and Applied Markets segment sells instruments and software that identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. DGG sells products that help customers obtain data from cellular and molecular samples. ACG sells chemistries, supplies, services and software that help to improve productivity inside its customers\\' labs.

       "   'title': \"Did Agilent Technologies' (NYSE:A) Share Price Deserve to Gain 80%?\",\n",
       "   'text': \"When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) share price is up 80% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (ignoring dividends).\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies\\n\\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\\n\\nOver half a decade, Agilent Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 32% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\\n\\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\\n\\nNYSE:A Past and Future Earnings May 1st 2020 More\\n\\nThis free interactive report on Agilent Technologies's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\\n\\nWhat About Dividends?\\n\\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Agilent Technologies, it has a TSR of 89% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nInvestors in Agilent Technologies had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.4% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 1.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Agilent Technologies that you should be aware of.\\n\\nOf course Agilent Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.\\n\\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.\\n\\nIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.

       "   'title': 'The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About - April 30, 2020',\n",
       "   'text': \"Being that unique investor who has the power to constantly time the market and continually make a profit is the dream for most traders and investors.\\n\\nEven among those who don't aspire to be the perfect market timer, many think they can call a top and act accordingly. It's at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a 'perceived' better opportunity to invest in the market.\\n\\nIndividual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances. For example, many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Computer and Technology stocks at the first opportunity, by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs: ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (AACAY), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI), Apple Inc. (AAPL)\\n\\nInvestment emotional triggers (fear and greed) can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader.\\n\\nProductive market timing requires three key parts: 1) A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks. 2) The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely. 3) The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment.\\n\\nMany investors believe that market timing is a short-term investment strategy. There is a less known, more effective, longer-term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet.\\n\\nRule 1: Never try and time tops and bottoms.\\n\\nForget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit, regardless of whether your calls are spot-on or way off-base.\\n\\nRule 2: Try not to sell amid little crashes - instead exploit the opportunity by buying.\\n\\nWarren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard. He benefits by focusing on the long - term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road.\\n\\nThere is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset. The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction, you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact. Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn, purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared, and being scared when others are greedy.\\n\\nA Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets\\n\\nIt's just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market. But consider this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn't be worth the energy - and given that even the experts generally fail at it, market timing shouldn't be your exclusive investing strategy of choice, especially using assets earmarked for your retirement.\\n\\nChasing alpha, outsized, short - term returns through market timing and other high - risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources, however for your long - term retirement assets a 'risk-adjusted' investment discipline is what largely bodes well.\\n\\nIf you'd like to learn how to 'super-charge' your retirement assets, get our free report:\\n\\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) has withdrawn its earlier announced guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2020 on account of the coronavirus outbreak. The company has been facing disruption in business activities owing to coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nAlthough Agilent’s fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruption in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Its customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus More\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nGuidance Withdrawn\\n\\nDuring fiscal first-quarter 2020 conference call, Agilent provided its guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2020. It had expected fiscal second-quarter revenues between $1.28 billion and $1.32 billion, and earnings per share in the range of 72-76 cents.\\n\\nAgilent had anticipated fiscal 2020 revenues in the range of $5.50-$5.55 billion, indicating core growth of 4-5%, and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $3.38-$3.43 per share.\\n\\nIt had cautioned that the outbreak of coronavirus is a concern for the company and would impact end-user demand.\\n\\nIt has now withdrawn this guidance, citing that the uncertainty of the impact of the outbreak on financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nThe coronavirus outbreak has dealt further blow to the electronic and testing equipment industry, which was already reeling under the protracted U.S.-China trade tensions and waning global demand. Factory closures across the globe, impact of restrictions imposed by different governments, supply chain disruptions, and low demand for goods, among others, have hit the sector hard.\\n\\nHowever, Agilent’s financial position and long-term prospects remain strong. Its expanding product portfolio and end-market strength should continue to remain key growth drivers. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should serve as a tailwind for Agilent. Further, the company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative high-margin product launches is a positive.\\n\\nThe company will release fiscal second-quarter results on May 21.\\n\\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\\n\\nAgilent currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The turnover rate for the quarter was 25%; the fund sold out of its common stock holdings in 11 companies and established new holdings in eight companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Parnassus Fund's strategy is to seek long-term capital appreciation through securities that have wide moats, relevancy over the long term, quality management teams and a market price below intrinsic value. It is a contrarian fund that focuses on out-of-favor companies, with the exclusion of those involved in the production of fossil fuels.

The top holdings were Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) at 7.04%, Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) at 4.7% and Nvidia Corp. at 4.62%. In terms of sector weighting, the fund is most invested in technology, health care and industrials.\\n\\naba2ce0df7f22270c21984098c6b509c.png More\\n\\nBased on the above investing criteria, the fund's top new buys in the first quarter of 2020 were KLA Corp.

The trade had a 3.61% impact on the equity portfolio.

       "   'title': 'Timing the Market, Is it Possible? - April 07, 2020',\n",
       "   'text': 'In the long-run, does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor?\\n\\nIndeed, even among the individuals who don\\'t seek to be the ideal market timer, many feel they can call a top and act in accordance. It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market.\\n\\nMissed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self-directed investors. Case in point: How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks listed below to correct, only to see them reach new highs, climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels: Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (AACAY), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI), Apple Inc. (AAPL), ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN)\\n\\nDread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely \\'reacting\\' to market volatility, rather than envisioning market trends.\\n\\nFruitful market timing requires three key parts: 1) A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks (or securities, gold or different kinds of investments). 2) The capacity to act on the sign accurately. 3) The control to follow up on it.\\n\\nMany investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition. But there is a less notable, rather straightforward, successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet.\\n\\nRule 1: Never attempt and time tops and bottoms.\\n\\nAbandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit, and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long-term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong.\\n\\nRule 2: Try not to sell amid little crashes - instead exploit the opportunity by buying.\\n\\nWarren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule. He cautions not to sell during little crashes, and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul.\\n\\nThere is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset. If you own shares of a company that is well - established and has strong fundamentals, they are probably going to rebound to their pre - crash prices eventually, thereby rendering holding on a wise decision. Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn, basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling - down on his very own recommendations.\\n\\nWhen It Comes to Trading Your Retirement, A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed\\n\\nIt\\'s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market. But, think about this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn\\'t be worth the energy - and given that even the experts generally fail at it, market timing shouldn\\'t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice, especially using assets earmarked for your retirement.\\n\\nActively trading for alpha, outsized, short - term gains through market timing and other high - risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets, but for your longer - term retirement assets, a \"risk -adjusted focused\" investment solution generally makes more sense.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to learn how to \\'super-charge\\' your retirement assets, get our free report:\\n\\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.

       "   'text': 'In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) by estimating the company\\'s future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. I will be using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don\\'t get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\\n\\nWe generally believe that a company\\'s value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies\\n\\nCrunching the numbers\\n\\nWe\\'re using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company\\'s growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\\n\\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today\\'s value:\\n\\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\\n\\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$682.2m US$1.12b US$1.29b US$1.30b US$1.32b US$1.34b US$1.36b US$1.39b US$1.41b US$1.43b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x5 Analyst x7 Analyst x5 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.45% Est @ 1.53% Est @ 1.6% Est @ 1.64% Est @ 1.67% Est @ 1.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$634 US$966 US$1.0k US$971 US$915 US$863 US$815 US$769 US$726 US$686\\n\\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\\n\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.4b\\n\\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the intial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 10-year government bond rate (1.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \\'growth\\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\\'s value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.\\n\\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2029 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 1.7%) ÷ 7.6%– 1.7%) = US$25b\\n\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$12b\\n\\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\\n\\nNYSE:A Intrinsic value April 1st 2020 More\\n\\nThe assumptions\\n\\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company\\'s future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Agilent Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\\'ve used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.086. Beta is a measure of a stock\\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\\n\\nStory continues',\n",

While most companies are still saying it’s too early to assess the full impact, many are attempting to offer some evaluation of lost sales or hits to earnings.\\n\\nThis is what companies have been saying:\\n\\n• 3M Co. US:MMM said demand for respirators is currently outpacing supply, and that increased demand for respirators during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 generated $250 million in revenue for the company. “That’s maybe the best frame to think about it for coronavirus at this point,” CEO Mike Roman said at an investor conference.\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. US:ANF expects an adverse impact of $60 million to $80 million on sales this year as a result of the outbreak. It has also lost $4 million “primarily from store closures in mainland China due to the coronavirus.” Abercrombie’s Asia-Pacific region made up less than 10% of 2019 sales, and its total manufacturing exposure to China was 22% in fiscal 2019. “We’ve given ourselves some provision I guess I would say on the European tourism business to continue to suffer a little bit as the travel restrictions get more and more intense,” CFO Scott Lipesky said during an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Agilent Techonologies Inc. US:A expects earnings of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion “after factoring in the potential impact” of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. “Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,” CFO Robert McMahon said. “This reduced the number of shipping days in China.”\\n\\nRead also:Consumer-facing companies will be the first hit if the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\\n\\n• Alcoa Corp. US:AA, which makes aluminum products, said it is seeing supply chain bottlenecks in China for bauxite, caustic and coal gas that are lowering production. “It’s driving a shortage of alumina inside of China, which is then starting to see the Chinese alumina price increase and you see the knock-on impact in the rest of the world with prices also increasing, pricing up by about $20 per ton over these last few weeks,” CEO Roy Harvey told investors.\\n\\n• American Airlines Group Inc. US:AAL is reducing international and domestic capacity through the summer peak season as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

US:ADI updated its guidance for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. “While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Apple Inc. US:AAPL is not expecting to meet second-quarter financial guidance because production has slowed or been halted in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Apple generates about 15% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there.\\n\\nRead also: Apple’s coronavirus warning wasn’t a total surprise, but magnitude rattles Wall Street\\n\\n• Best Buy Inc. US:BBY, which sources a lot of its consumer electronics products from China, said it assumes that most of the impact from the coronavirus will happen during the first half of the year. “Therefore, we view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said in a statement. “Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimates of the impacts at this time.” On the company’s earnings call, executives stressed that it was still a fluid situation and they are attempting to gauge when factories will be fully back up and running and whether global vendors have sufficient inventory.\\n\\n• Boston Scientific Corp. US:BSX, which has a $600 million business in China, is expecting a “negative first-half impact” on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. The company lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a “preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.”\\n\\n• Brown-Forman Corp. US:BF, the parent company of the Jack Daniel’s whiskey brand, lowered guidance to reflect global uncertainty and the effect of the coronavirus.

US:CPRI, which owns luxury brands Jimmy Choo and Versace, said it now expects annual revenue of $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50 as the virus eats into sales.

It’s anyone’s guess right now\\n\\n• Carnival Corp. US:CCL said there could be a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share impact of 55 cents to 65 cents if all operations are suspended in Asia through the end of April. If that comes to pass, according to Carnival, there would be a material impact on the business from suspended cruises in Chinese ports; cancellations in other parts of Asia; and the impact on bookings, which is determined by the length of time that an event influences travel.\\n\\n• The Coca-Cola Company US:KO said it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola’s global volume, the company said in January. “China’s economy was in a different place when SARS happened,” CEO James Quincey said in January. “It’s worth noting that China’s economy is [now] much bigger, and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.” In its 10-K filing with the SEC, the company also said it has seen delays in the production and export of ingredients used in nonnutritive sweeteners. It doesn’t expect a hit to its full-year results for now.\\n\\n• Crocs Inc. US:CROX expects first-quarter revenue to be hurt by $20 million to $30 million due to disruptions in Asia from the coronavirus.

US:DAL is reducing capacity by 15 points, implementing a hiring freeze, offering voluntary leave, and deferring spending as it struggles with the fallout from the coronavirus.

US:DG is “strongly encouraging” that the first hour of store operations be dedicated solely for senior shoppers, who are the most vulnerable to infection. “Dollar General wants to provide these at-risk customers with the ability to purchase the items they need and want at the beginning of each day to avoid busier and more crowded shopping periods,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Domino’s Pizza Inc. US:DPZ said that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino’s opened 80 net new stores in China.\\n\\n• Dow Inc. US:DOW expects the coronavirus to shave about $400 million off first-quarter sales, after business in China saw a 20% to 30% dip in sales. CFO Howard Ungerleider told an industrials conference that the chemicals company expects some additional sales impact, but that it is difficult to quantify for now. “However, if I had to size the total impact of COVID on our first quarter based on what I know today, both the impact in China and the knock-on impacts around the world, I would arrange the total impact to the Dow in the first quarter in the $200 million range on Ebitda,” the executive told attendees, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. US:DNKN has limited service to drive-through, carryout and delivery, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

US:ECL, a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. “If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,” he said, on an earnings call. “Before that, it didn’t exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.”\\n\\n• Eli Lilly and Co. US:LLY doesn’t expect any shortages of medicine, including insulin, as a result of the coronavirus. The company has been monitoring its supply chain for potential impact, and doesn’t source active pharmaceutical ingredients from China and insulin manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe have not been affected.\\n\\n• The Estée Lauder Cos. US:EL said the third quarter will be most impacted by the sales decline of luxury beauty products in China. The company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase of up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\n• Expedia Group Inc. US:EXPE is expecting a $30 million to $40 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. It also expects “some impact beyond [the first quarter] in 2020 as well,” CEO Barry Diller told investors. “But the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize.”\\n\\n• Exxon Mobil Corp. US:XOM is “looking to significantly reduce spending” in the near-term as a result of market conditions caused by the pandemic and commodity price decreases. “We will outline plans when they are finalized,” CEO Darren Woods said in a statement.\\n\\n• Foot Locker Inc. US:FL has closed stores across North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia and Malaysia through March 31. The athletic retailer has also withdrawn its full-year outlook and plans to provide an update with its first-quarter earnings announcement on May 22.\\n\\n• Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. US:FDP CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn’t expect the outbreak to fade away before April. “Usually these viruses, they don’t subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,” Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\\n\\n• General Electric Co. US:GE expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 13 cents, and negative free cash flow of about $2 billion. GE said while COVID-19 is an “evolving variable,” it currently expects a negative impact on first-quarter free cash flow of about $300 million to $500 million, and on operating income of $200 million to $300 million. The impacts are included in GE’s 2020 outlook.\\n\\n• General Mills Inc. US:GIS said half of its Häagen-Dazs shops in greater China are closed, and the shops that remain open have “severely restricted hours.” Greater China makes up 4% of General Mills’ net sales, 40% of its sales in the region are at Häagen-Dazs shops and other restaurants. The company told investors it can’t yet share how the closures will affect its numbers for fiscal 2020.\\n\\n• Gilead Sciences Inc. US:GILD is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for people with the new coronavirus.

US:HAS continues “to have office and third-party factory closures” in China as a result of the outbreak. The company said that China is responsible for about two-thirds of its global sourcing. “The biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up,” said Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas. “Travel is limited, [and] places are still closed.”\\n\\n• Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. US:HPE told investors it no longer expects revenue to grow in fiscal 2020, with one executive telling MarketWatch that he blames a 16% year-over-year decline in compute revenue ($3 billion) and 9% decline in total revenue on “microenvironment” issues such as supply-chain disruption and the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. US:HLT said about 150 hotels, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms, are closed in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• Hormel Foods Corp. US:HRL expects its international business to have a “very difficult” second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. “Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,” CEO James Snee told investors.\\n\\n• HP Inc. US:HPQ said it expects a “negative impact to our top line, bottom line and [free cash flow],” citing delayed production and manufacturing timelines. The technology giant said when taking into account the outbreak, it now anticipates earnings per share of 46 cents to 50 cents and adjusted EPS of 49 cents to 53 cents.\\n\\n• HSBC Holdings PLC US:HSBC expects a weaker first-half performance in 2020, due to the downturn in Hong Kong and virus-related credit losses in the first quarter, it said. “The most extreme downside scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year,” an executive said on an earnings call. “If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional loan losses provisions required.”\\n\\n• InterContinental Hotels Group PLC US:IHG said 160 hotels are closed in China or closed to new guests. The company’s fee business is expected to take a $5 million hit in February in China, as a result of the outbreak. Its Chinese operations make up less than 10% of group operating profit. CEO Keith Barr told investors that the postponement and cancellation of conferences will have an impact on its operations, too. “What I saw during H1N1 and other times in China, the key thing to remember is the Chinese government’s ability to stimulate economic growth and activity is unlike any other country,” he said, on an earnings call.\\n\\n• Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. US:IPG and Meredith Corp. US:MDP separately told investors that the advertising is seeing a small slowdown. “We’ve seen a slight pullback in luxury advertising related to the travel category, a couple of airlines, not domestic airlines, but actually international airlines pulled back a little bit,” Meredith’s CEO Thomas Harty said at an investor conference. IPG’s Michael Roth said at the same event that the ad giant has “seen cutbacks before on the project side of the business.” He also noted that the temporary move to a work-from-home culture may lead to additional business. “Clients are going to need our expertise in allocating media dollars where the clients are, whether they’re working at home or whether the consumers are working at home, and how you address the marketplace that’s different,” he said.\\n\\nSee:Coronavirus is disrupting tech conferences across the globe — what to know\\n\\n• IQVIA Inc. US:IQV, which runs clinical trials, including in China, said it expects a $25 million impact in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. “The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China because that’s kind of the more dangerous spot right now,” CEO Ari Bousbib told investors.\\n\\n• ITT Inc. US:ITT updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\\n\\n• JetBlue Airways Corp. US:JBLU said it will halt change and cancel fees for new flight bookings starting Thursday through March 11 for travel completed by June 1. “The policy is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns,” the airline said in a statement. The move will apply to all fares offered by JetBlue, including its cheapest fares, which generally do not allow for any changes or cancellations.\\n\\n• Johnson & Johnson US:JNJ expects a “modest impact” on sales of its skin care products as “people [are] buying less.\\n\\n• Lands’ End Inc. US:LE said the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in lower customer demand over the past week, and that it will not provide guidance for fiscal 2020 given the “rapidly changing business environment.”\\n\\n• L Brands Inc. US:LB closed all Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works stores in the U.S. and Canada through March 29 due to the pandemic. It also withdrew its guidance for the first quarter.\\n\\n• Lululemon Athletica Inc. US:LULU said that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3.

US:LYFT reported its “biggest week in our history in terms of both revenue and rides,” potentially driven by fear of the contracting the coronavirus on public transportation, CFO Brian Roberts said at a technology summit.\\n\\n• Marriott International Inc. US:MAR said while it could not “fully estimate the financial impact” from COVID-19, it would be “material to first quarter and full-year 2020 results.”\\n\\n• Mastercard Inc. US:MA said it expects to shave 2 to 3 percentage points from its first-quarter revenue guidance because of the impact of COVID-19 on “cross-border travel and, to a lesser extent, cross-border e-commerce growth.”\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC US:MDT told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\nWhat It’s Like for Cruise Ship Passengers During Coronavirus Outbreak\\n\\n• Michaels Companies Inc. US:MIK gave guidance ahead of expectations but that didn’t take into account the impact of the coronavirus. Mark Cosby, Michaels CEO, said the company doesn’t expect “material supply chain disruptions” in the first quarter but sales in certain categories are slowing.\\n\\n• Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT warned that it will not meet guidance for its fiscal third quarter due to COVID-19. Microsoft in late January guided for fiscal third-quarter sales for its More Personal Computing segment of $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion, which “included a wider-than-usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.” While there’s “strong” demand for Windows in line with the company’s expectations, the supply chain “is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. All other components of its Q3 guidance remain unchanged, Microsoft said.\\n\\n• Mondelēz Inc. US:MDLZ told investors to expect “an impact on both revenue and margins” as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. “I’m quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don’t see at this point,” CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\\n\\n• Nike Inc. US:NKE has closed about half its stores in China, while the remaining stores are reporting lower-than-expected retail traffic. The athletic-apparel maker said it plans to provide an update about the impact of the virus on its third-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n• Nordstrom Inc. US:JWN closed its U.S. and Canadian stores, including Nordstrom full-line, Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club clubhouses and Jeffrey, for two weeks.

The company also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance offered on March 3, which didn’t include the impact of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. US:NCLH expects the virus to shave off 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia — that’s 40 total — through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\\n\\n• OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. US:OSW, which provides on-board spa services to cruises, said in an earnings statement that it expects to lose $5 million in revenue and $2 million in adjusted EBITDA as a result of 141 canceled or modified voyages and lower revenue at its resort spas in Asia.\\n\\n• ON Semiconductor Corp. US:ON issued a revenue warning for the first quarter, due to the change in business conditions being created by the coronavirus. The Apple supplier now expects revenue to range from $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, compared with prior guidance of $1.355 billion to $1.405 billion, issued on Feb. 3. “We saw soft order trends in China in the weeks following Lunar New Year holidays, but orders have since picked up, and we have not seen any significant cancellations of orders,” CEO Keith Jackson said in a statement.\\n\\n• L’Oréal US:LRLCY said the impact from the outbreak will be temporary, based on the cosmetics maker’s experience with the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. What is different about this outbreak, however, is L’Oréal’s e-commerce sales of beauty products in China are stronger so far in February than they were this month last year. “This crisis will even strengthen the position of the e-commerce players in China,” CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors at an analyst conference.\\n\\n• Papa John’s International Inc. US:PZZA said it has closed about 50 franchised stores in China as a result of the outbreak. Although the pizza company said the impact of the store closures isn’t currently material to its earnings, uncertainty about the spread of the virus could “lead to lower sales [and] widespread store closures or delays in our supply chain, which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results.”\\n\\n• PayPal Holdings Inc. US:PYPL expects the coronavirus to have a negative revenue impact of 1 percentage point for the March quarter and is expecting revenue for the quarter to fall toward the low end of its guidance of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion. “Stronger performance quarter-to-date across our diversified business is partially offsetting this one percentage point negative impact,” PayPal said.\\n\\n• Procter & Gamble Co. US:PG expects the outbreak to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant’s second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\\n\\n• PVH Corp. US:PVH, owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, said that 20% of its global sourcing comes from greater China, which also made up 7% of its 2019 revenue.

Still, the company reaffirmed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $1.79 for the fourth quarter and at least $9.45 for the full year.\\n\\n• Qorvo Inc. US:QRVO cut its revenue outlook, citing the estimated impact the coronavirus outbreak is having on the smartphone supply chain.

US:RL said fiscal 2020 sales could be hurt by up to $70 million and operating income in Asia could take a $35 million to $45 million hit as a result of the outbreak.

US:RCL canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries as a result of the virus. The cruise-line operator said it expects an impact of 65 cents per share on its 2020 financial performance. If it has to cancel cruises in Asia through April, doing so would impact the company’s 2020 financial performance by an additional 55 cents a share.\\n\\n• Sabre Corp. US:SABR said the coronavirus will have a “material impact” on its 2020 results, as the outbreak has weighed on travel bookings so far this year. The company said the estimated impact for the first quarter of earnings per share of 14 cents to 23 cents and for revenue of $100 million to $150 million.\\n\\n• Sanderson Farms Inc. US:SAFM said the outbreak of African swine fever in China should eventually boost the poultry market in the U.S., but COVID-19 is now disrupting markets in China, depressing demand, hurting shipping and supply chain logistics and slowing China’s economic growth rate. The chicken meat producer said the Chinese lifting of the ban on chicken from the U.S. had led to orders for about 18 million pounds of chicken products.\\n\\n• Skechers USA Inc. US:SKX said the impact of COVID-19 had worsened since it last updated investors when it reported earnings on Feb. 6. Skechers offered guidance at that time for first-quarter sales of $1.400 billion to $1.425 billion, and earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents. “Things definitely have deteriorated to a degree,” CFO John Vandemore told investors at a UBS conference. He also said the big change is now coming in European countries that have experienced clusters of the illness, with Italy closing schools and universities.\\n\\n• Southwest Airlines Co.

US:SAVE told investors they shouldn’t rely on its 2020 financial guidance given the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The discount air carrier said at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference that it has seen “significant pressure” on fares since the end of February and “modest” pressure on load factor.\\n\\n• Stanley Black & Decker Inc. US:SWK expects the outbreak to “cause some pressure for us in March and April from a revenue perspective,” according to remarks made by CFO Donald Allan at an investor conference. The company generates about $250 million in annual revenue in China and runs 10 plants there, which are operating at about 50% to 60% capacity, as of last week.\\n\\n• Starbucks Corp. US:SBUX, the Seattle-based coffee chain, said it was already “showing early signs of recovery” in China and that U.S. sales are still strong despite the coronavirus. “To date, there are no perceptible signs of COVID-19 impact on our U.S. business, which accounted for approximately 65% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020,” the coffee chain said in a financial filing. The company’s shareholder meeting will be “virtual only” this year due to the coronavirus.\\n\\n• TripAdvisor Inc. US:TRIP said it may see a low-single-digit percentage impact on its financial results. “We do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we’re not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business,” CEO Stephen Kaufer told analysts.\\n\\n• Tyson Foods Inc. US:TSN has restarted some operations in China, but CEO Noel White said the company will face short-term impacts from the outbreak, even if the fallout eventually helps support government efforts in China to “decrease” the number of wet markets. Researchers believe that the virus, common to bats, may have been transmitted to humans via another animal sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan. “We’ll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China,” White said. “The combination of [African swine fever] and coronavirus would expedite that transition.”\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. US:UA expects to lose between $50 million and $60 million in sales to the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• United Airlines Holdings Inc. US:UAL rescinded its annual revenue guidance for 2020, saying the outbreak is too unpredictable to ensure that the forecast it issued two months ago will hold up. The airline will cut flight capacity by 10% domestically and 20% internationally in April due to the coronavirus outbreak. Executives Oscar Munoz and Scott Kirby will forego their base salaries, effective immediately through June 30, and the company has withdrawn its first-quarter guidance. Net bookings to Asia and Europe are down 100%; the company’s “dire scenario planning assumption” is that revenue will be down 70% in April and May. In comparison, demand was down 40% for the two months following 9/11. Kirby said he expects to recover demand within 18 months.\\n\\n• Urban Outfitters Inc.’s US:URBN store traffic and sales fell over the past week in cities including Milan and Seattle where the coronavirus is having a heavy impact. Other cities have been affected as well. The company, which also operates Anthropologie and Free People, said it can’t forecast how the company will be impacted in the first quarter because of the uncertainty around the outbreak.\\n\\n• Vail Resorts Inc. US:MTN said earnings and revenue were lower than analysts expected and rescinded its annual guidance as it sees business declining. “In the week ended March 8, 2020, we saw a marked negative change in performance from the prior week, with destination skier visits modestly below expectations,” Chief Executive Rob Katz said in a news release. “We expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in upcoming weeks.”\\n\\n• VF Corp.

The company said the virus was having a “significant impact” on Asia-related travel that has caused a “sharp slowdown of our cross-border business” for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc. US:WMT anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. “Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,” Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\\n\\n• Walt Disney Co. US:DIS said if its shuttered Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks remain closed for months, it would shave $175 million off operating income in the current quarter. Disney’s movie-studio business could also take a hit, as cinemas are closed in China and Disney is preparing to launch the live-action “Mulan” reboot in March.\\n\\n• Wolverine World Wide Inc. US:WWW provided a downbeat full-year outlook, citing the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its shoe brands, which include Hush Puppies, Sperry, and Stride Rite.

The decision was made because of the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Xenia Hotels & Resorts Inc. US:XHR withdrew the 2020 guidance provided in late February, citing increased uncertainty regarding the financial impact resulting from the coronavirus outbreak.

US:YUMC, which operates fast-food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For those that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing “significant interruption,” said Yum China Holdings CEO Joey Wat. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\\n\\n• Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. US:ZBH said the number of elective procedures in China, which makes up about 5% of global revenue, fell by up to 90% in February, and CFO Suketu Upadhyay expects that to continue through March “at a minimum.” There are also now early signs that procedures are slowing down in South Korea.\\n\\n• Zoom Video Communications Inc.

       "   'text': 'In the long-run, does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor?\\n\\nIndeed, even among those investors who don\\'t try to consistently time the markets, many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically. It\\'s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market.\\n\\nGiving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement. For example, many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks to correct, only see the latter achieve new highs, move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels: Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (AACAY), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI), Apple Inc. (AAPL), ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN)\\n\\nFear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react, rather than anticipate market moves.\\n\\nFruitful market timing requires three key parts: 1) A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks (or securities, gold or different kinds of investments). 2) The capacity to act on the sign accurately. 3) The control to follow up on it.\\n\\nMarket timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly. However, there is a less common, rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time.\\n\\nRule 1: Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose-lose situation.\\n\\nForget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit, regardless of whether your calls are spot-on or way off-base.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRule 2: Don\\'t sell during minor crashes - instead, have the patience to weather the storm, or even better, milk the opportunity to buy low.\\n\\nWarren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard. He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul.\\n\\nThere is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10% market correction. If the companies you own are established and successful, they are likely to return to their pre - crash price before long, making holding on the wisest decision. Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn, essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice, \\'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\\'\\n\\nA Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets\\n\\nIt\\'s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market. But, think about this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Indeed, even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn\\'t justify the efforts - and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it, market timing shouldn\\'t be your exclusive methodology for investing, particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg.\\n\\nActively trading for alpha, outsized, short - term gains through market timing and other high - risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets, but for your longer - term retirement assets, a \"risk -adjusted focused\" investment solution generally makes more sense.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to learn how to \\'super-charge\\' your retirement assets, get our free report:\\n\\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.

And it should be no surprise that analysts expect a decent report when Walmart announces quarterly earnings ahead of the May 19 bell. Analysts are looking for a 5.2% improvement in revenues to $130.31 billion, which should fuel a 3.5% bump in profits to $1.17 per share. The question for shareholders is: What does WMT have left in the tank? While Wall Street is still broadly bullish on the name - the stock racked up 17 Buy ratings over the past quarter, versus just six Holds - RBC Capital analyst Scot Ciccarelli (Sector Perform, equivalent of Hold) sees \"limited\" upside. While the company has sales momentum and can be a prime recession stock, Ciccarelli says higher labor and cleaning costs, as well as a frothy valuation, could keep a lid on the stock.\\n\\nEarnings Spotlight: Home Depot (HD, $239.33) - Home Depot is another major name reporting in what will be a big week for retailers. Like Walmart, Home Depot has been deemed \"essential,\" and is widely expected to benefit from an uptick in DIY projects as many people are confined to their homes - that\\'s largely why investors have bid shares up nearly 10% year-to-date. Wells Fargo\\'s Zachary Fadem (Overweight, equivalent of Buy) recently raised his price target on shares from $215 to $260, believing the company will top analyst estimates in its Tuesday morning report, and writing that the company deserves its premium valuation. Wall Street analysts are looking for 3.4% year-over-year revenue growth to $27.28 billion, but a marginal decline in profits to $2.26 per share.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOther Noteworthy Reports: Advance Auto Parts (AAP), Netease (NTES), Sina (SINA), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Weibo (WB)\\n\\nWEDNESDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Analog Devices (ADI), Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories (RDY), Expedia Group (EXPE), Huya (HUYA), L Brands (LB), Lowe\\'s (LOW), McKesson (MCK), Shoe Carnival (SCVL), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Target (TGT), VEREIT (VER), ZTO Express (ZTO)\\n\\nTHURSDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Agilent Technologies (A), Apollo Investment (AINV), Best Buy (BBY), BJ\\'s Wholesale Club (BJ), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL), Intuit (INTU), Nvidia (NVDA), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Ross Stores (ROST), SeaDrill (SDRL), Splunk (SPLK), Teekay Corp.

BABA shares are only slightly outperforming the Chinese market, at 4% losses versus about 6% for the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI). Nonetheless, it\\'s still a wildly popular pick in the analyst community, where 13 pros have rattled off Buy-equivalent ratings over the past three months, with no opposition. CLSA\\'s Elinor Leung (Buy) notes that Alibaba\\'s recovery isn\\'t even across the board - staples sales have grown, consumer electronics have been resilient, but discretionary products are slow to bounce back.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nThe most sustainable companies outside the U.S. outperformed a key benchmark for international stocks, mirroring the strength of the companies in Barron’s third annual ranking of the 100 most environmentally and socially responsible businesses in this country.\\n\\nThe 20 companies in the ranking, compiled by Calvert Research & Management, a unit of Eaton Vance (ticker: EV), returned 23.6% for 2019, compared with the 22% return for the MSCI EAFE benchmark, which is much broader and contains 917 companies.\\n\\nTopping the list of non-U.S. companies is Australia’s Brambles (BXB.Australia), which supplies shipping pallets all over the world, and Ireland-based consulting company Accenture (ACN), at No. 2. The two switched places from 2018.\\n\\nBrambles helps customers cut waste and emissions, partly by reusing packaging. Nearly all its wood is sustainably sourced, while 60% of its electricity is from renewables. Brambles shares are “favorably” positioned, Morgan Stanley recently said, because the company has a substantial stock buyback program and limited exposure to Asia, where coronavirus fears are hurting sentiment.\\n\\nAccenture, meanwhile, has “lots of positives from an employee standpoint,” partly because of a strong retraining program that helps transfer workers displaced by artificial intelligence and automation, says Calvert analyst Chris Madden. The company also has done a good job avoiding assignments with clients with poor ethical profiles, says Bruno Bertocci, head of sustainable equities at UBS Asset Management.\\n\\nSustainable Non-US Companies Outperform Source: Calvert Research & Management; Bloomberg\\n\\nThe ranking also contains a number of hospitality companies, such as France’s Accor (AC.France), and Britain’s Whitbread (WTB.UK). “They’ve been reducing their water and energy footprints,” says Calvert’s Madden.\\n\\nAs a group, the companies generally had higher environmental, social, and governance scores, as determined by Calvert, than the U.S. companies. For example, the weighted ESG score for Brambles is 81, while Accenture’s is 80. Seven companies on the list had weighted scores of 77 and 76, matching or beating Agilent (A), the top U.S. company, with a 76.\\n\\n“The scores tend to skew a little higher internationally,” says Madden, partly because of a broader historical recognition in Europe of the needs of stakeholders aside from shareholders. In addition, “regulatory heft in Europe is put behind a lot of environmental and social issues,” he says. Six of the companies are from the U.K., and five from France.\\n\\nDeveloped-market companies outside the U.S. have historically had better disclosure, says UBS’s Bertocci, but the gap between the U.S. and Europe has narrowed so that for the largest companies, “it’s pretty much nonexistent at this point.” Adoption of global disclosure recommendations such as those from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures have helped to diminish the differential.\\n\\nSustainability is directly connected to profitability and thus to stock-price performance. “These issues drive demand for company products, drive operational efficiency within companies, and build productivity across the workforce, all key factors to the competitiveness of a company and its ability to produce a high return on invested capital,” says John Streur, CEO of Calvert.\\n\\nAs a group, the companies are hardly cheap, although their yields are appealing. Collectively, the 20 companies in our ranking have a forward price/earnings ratio of 19.1 times, a P/E to growth rate of 14.1, and a dividend yield of 4.1%. By contrast, the EAFE index has a forward P/E of 15.2 times, a P/E to growth rate of 4.4, and a yield of 3.3%.\\n\\nTo create the Barron’s list of 20 overseas stocks, Calvert started with the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies internationally by market value, ranking them by how they performed for shareholders, employees, customers, community, and the planet. It looked at more than 230 performance indicators that address ESG issues, such as workplace diversity, data security, and greenhouse-gas emissions.\\n\\nBased on the indicators, Calvert assigned a score of zero to 100 in each stakeholder category. Then, it created a weighted average of the categories for each company, based on how financially material each category was for its industry peer group.\\n\\nA more detailed description of the methodology is available at this link.\\n\\nWrite to Leslie P.

Prices pulled back to test the rising 50-day moving average line and trading volume did not expand which a good pattern to observe. Prices are now back above the rising 50-day line and the bullish 200-day line is at a comfortable distance below the price of A.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line but narrowing towards a potential go-long signal.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices broke out on the upside of a long sideways to rising consolidation pattern. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has broken out on the upside of its long sideways pattern and tells us that aggressive buying has been taking place. The MACD oscillator on this longer time frame is bullish, but we could see a crossover to the downside depending on how weak price get in the short-run.\\n\\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of A, below, we used daily price data and here the chart shows that A has reached (and exceeded) a price target.\\n\\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of A, below, we used weekly price data and here a potential price target of $97 is indicated.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: Traders could approach the long side of A at current levels risking a close below $82.

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) has broken out to a new all-time high. What chart points are now important for this leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets?\\n\\nLet's check.\\n\\nIn this daily bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have rallied 50% from their March low and have made new highs above the January peak. The slopes of the 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving average line are positive and we are about to see the 50-day line cross above the 200-day line for a bullish golden cross signal.\\n\\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has made its own new high to confirm the uptrend and tells us that buyers of A have been more aggressive since the March low. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bullish and pointed upwards.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have been in a wide sideways trading range since early 2018. This is a large consolidation pattern and could support a large move higher.\\n\\nThe center point of this pattern could be considered $75 and it would not be unusual for prices to double from this level. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\\n\\nThe weekly OBV line looks like it will make a new all-time high soon and the MACD oscillator crossed above the zero line last month for an outright buy signal.\\n\\nIn this daily Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a price projection of $99.\\n\\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a potential price projection of $123.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: The list of stocks that are making new all-time highs is growing and A is now on that list. Traders could go long A on a dip into the $90-$88 area risking a close below $84. $99 and then $123 area our price targets.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'In this article you are going to find out whether hedge funds think Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It\\'s not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) was in 35 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of March. A investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest in recent months. There were 46 hedge funds in our database with A positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that A isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds\\' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 51 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren\\'t comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.\\n\\n[caption id=\"attachment_607931\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"] Bill Ackman of Pershing Square[/caption]\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea.

We interview hedge fund managers and ask them about their best ideas. If you want to find out the best healthcare stock to buy right now, you can watch our latest hedge fund manager interview here. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when the S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Now let\\'s view the latest hedge fund action encompassing Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A).\\n\\nHedge fund activity in Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A)\\n\\nAt Q1\\'s end, a total of 35 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -24% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 41 hedge funds with a bullish position in A a year ago. With the smart money\\'s positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a select group of notable hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes significantly (or already accumulated large positions).\\n\\nIs A A Good Stock To Buy?

Quote\\n\\nCash Position\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal second-quarter 2020, Agilent’s cash and short-term investments totaled $1.32 billion compared with $1.23 billion at prior quarter-end. Long-term debt was $1.8 billion, flat sequentially.\\n\\nDuring the recently reported quarter, operating cash flow was $313 million. Agilent paid $55 million in dividends and repurchased 1.66 million shares for $126 million.\\n\\nIn our view, the stock offering is expected to boost financial flexibility and help the company meet financial obligations in an efficient way. Moreover, it provides ample scope to deploy capital for long-term growth opportunities and rewarding higher returns to stockholders.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAgilent’s expanding product portfolio, end-market strength and robust performance in key markets are growth drivers. Moreover, the company’s decision to divest/wind up underperforming businesses is beneficial for core operations.\\n\\nRecently, Agilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to drive top-line growth.

Both deliver even faster detection of target compounds providing customers increased sample throughput and reduced time to generate results. The instruments are being introduced at ASMS 2020 Reboot, the interactive, online version of the annual conference of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, being held June 1-12, 2020.\\n\\n\"Agilent continues to strive to meet the evolving needs of our mass spec customers, and address the challenges they face daily,\" said Monty Benefiel, vice president, and general manager of Agilent\\'s Mass Spectrometry Division. \"These new products offer customers workflow solutions that maximize sample throughput and stability, as well as greater reliability than ever before.\"\\n\\nThe 6470B system includes enhancements that boost system uptime and improve overall system performance for low-level detection in routine, high-throughput environments. Customers running a single chromatographic method for applications such as multi-residue screening will see greater data fidelity, reproducibility, and sensitivity. The system integrates seamlessly into existing analytical labs and customer workflows—and it offers quicker routine maintenance through the addition of VacShield technology, designed to easily remove ion injectors without venting.\\n\\nThe high-throughput RapidFire 400 integrated autosampler provides fast results with cycle times as short as 2 sec/sample and adds optional sample cooling for greater sample stability. The system includes barcode reading capabilities for sample tracking, now supports 1,536 well plates, and allows unattended operation for the analysis of more than 98,000 samples. It is further designed to integrate with the Ultivo LC/TQ system, further reducing lab space requirements.\\n\\nAbout Agilent Technologies\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

And they upped a stake of Restaurant Brands International QSR, -1.29% QSR, -1.29% , owner of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s, by more than 50%. Pershing Square said as budget-conscious consumers trade down due to the pandemic, they’ll head to cheaper eateries like those.\\n\\nPershing is sticking to fast-food chain Chipotle CMG, -0.77% for its “fortress balance sheet” and zero debt. Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, -3.13% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +0.26% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, -1.05% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +3.64% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis. On the upside, people still value homeownership now, said Ackman.\\n\\nThe chart\\n\\nThis Goldman Sachs chart shows the recovering, but bumpy trajectory for China consumer activity — includes hotels, movie, theater, retail sales, airline seat miles — post pandemic, versus the U.S., where it is obviously deeply depressed.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing. Americans are expected to move more freely over the coming long Memorial Day holiday weekend that signals the start of summer.\\n\\nRead now: States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: More beaches, casinos open ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend\\n\\nIt also comes as an ABC News/Ispos poll found that just 39% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, the lowest reading for the president since the poll started to track sentiment in March.\\n\\nA Fox News poll published on Thursday found just 44% of those polled approve of Trump’s performance, down from 49% in April. The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co. F, +6.13% plant that has switched production to make ventilators and masks. Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic. They have been regularly touted by President Donald Trump, who said this week that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine. A number of clinical trials are underway evaluating the medications as both a treatment or a prophylactic for those at high-risk of contracting the virus.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThere are now 5.24 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and at least 338,762 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.

A.B. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, echoing the concerns of other analysts on the conference call, expressed wariness over what he called another “significant multi-year effort” by HPE to slash costs.

BABA, -0.26% , which offered a first look at how China is faring as it comes out of lockdown.\\n\\nElsewhere, companies continued to issue debt and equity, and to update investors and customers on their reopening plans.\\n\\nRead: ‘The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating’: Americans brace for another coronavirus outbreak in the fall\\n\\nHere are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Agilent Technologies Inc. A, +0.71% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +8.04% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +2.24% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.08% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -1.17% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +1.19% UAA, +1.06% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our \"building and buying\" strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\\n\\nAnd now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Ankur and thanks, everyone for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

This compares to earnings of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 22.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this scientific instrument maker would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering no surprise.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\\n\\nAgilent, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.24 billion for the quarter ended April 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nAgilent shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -8%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Agilent?\\n\\nWhile Agilent has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $1.20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.95 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The slopes of the 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving average line are positive and we are about to see the 50-day line cross above the 200-day line for a bullish golden cross signal.\\n\\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has made its own new high to confirm the uptrend and tells us that buyers of A have been more aggressive since the March low. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bullish and pointed upwards.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have been in a wide sideways trading range since early 2018. This is a large consolidation pattern and could support a large move higher.\\n\\nThe center point of this pattern could be considered $75 and it would not be unusual for prices to double from this level. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\\n\\nThe weekly OBV line looks like it will make a new all-time high soon and the MACD oscillator crossed above the zero line last month for an outright buy signal.\\n\\nIn this daily Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a price projection of $99.\\n\\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a potential price projection of $123.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: The list of stocks that are making new all-time highs is growing and A is now on that list. Traders could go long A on a dip into the $90-$88 area risking a close below $84. $99 and then $123 area our price targets.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, -3.13% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +0.26% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, -1.05% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +3.64% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis. On the upside, people still value homeownership now, said Ackman.\\n\\nThe chart\\n\\nThis Goldman Sachs chart shows the recovering, but bumpy trajectory for China consumer activity — includes hotels, movie, theater, retail sales, airline seat miles — post pandemic, versus the U.S., where it is obviously deeply depressed.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing.

The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments.

A, +0.71% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +8.04% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +2.24% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.08% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -1.17% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +1.19% UAA, +1.06% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) has broken out to a new all-time high. What chart points are now important for this leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets?\\n\\nLet's check.\\n\\nIn this daily bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have rallied 50% from their March low and have made new highs above the January peak. The slopes of the 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving average line are positive and we are about to see the 50-day line cross above the 200-day line for a bullish golden cross signal.\\n\\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has made its own new high to confirm the uptrend and tells us that buyers of A have been more aggressive since the March low. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bullish and pointed upwards.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have been in a wide sideways trading range since early 2018. This is a large consolidation pattern and could support a large move higher.\\n\\nThe center point of this pattern could be considered $75 and it would not be unusual for prices to double from this level. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\\n\\nThe weekly OBV line looks like it will make a new all-time high soon and the MACD oscillator crossed above the zero line last month for an outright buy signal.\\n\\nIn this daily Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a price projection of $99.\\n\\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a potential price projection of $123.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: The list of stocks that are making new all-time highs is growing and A is now on that list. Traders could go long A on a dip into the $90-$88 area risking a close below $84. $99 and then $123 area our price targets.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'In this article you are going to find out whether hedge funds think Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It\\'s not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) was in 35 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of March. A investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest in recent months. There were 46 hedge funds in our database with A positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that A isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds\\' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 51 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren\\'t comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.\\n\\n[caption id=\"attachment_607931\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"] Bill Ackman of Pershing Square[/caption]\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea.

We interview hedge fund managers and ask them about their best ideas. If you want to find out the best healthcare stock to buy right now, you can watch our latest hedge fund manager interview here. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when the S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. Now let\\'s view the latest hedge fund action encompassing Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A).\\n\\nHedge fund activity in Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A)\\n\\nAt Q1\\'s end, a total of 35 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -24% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 41 hedge funds with a bullish position in A a year ago. With the smart money\\'s positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a select group of notable hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes significantly (or already accumulated large positions).\\n\\nIs A A Good Stock To Buy?

Quote\\n\\nCash Position\\n\\nAt the end of fiscal second-quarter 2020, Agilent’s cash and short-term investments totaled $1.32 billion compared with $1.23 billion at prior quarter-end. Long-term debt was $1.8 billion, flat sequentially.\\n\\nDuring the recently reported quarter, operating cash flow was $313 million. Agilent paid $55 million in dividends and repurchased 1.66 million shares for $126 million.\\n\\nIn our view, the stock offering is expected to boost financial flexibility and help the company meet financial obligations in an efficient way. Moreover, it provides ample scope to deploy capital for long-term growth opportunities and rewarding higher returns to stockholders.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAgilent’s expanding product portfolio, end-market strength and robust performance in key markets are growth drivers. Moreover, the company’s decision to divest/wind up underperforming businesses is beneficial for core operations.\\n\\nRecently, Agilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to drive top-line growth.

Both deliver even faster detection of target compounds providing customers increased sample throughput and reduced time to generate results. The instruments are being introduced at ASMS 2020 Reboot, the interactive, online version of the annual conference of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, being held June 1-12, 2020.\\n\\n\"Agilent continues to strive to meet the evolving needs of our mass spec customers, and address the challenges they face daily,\" said Monty Benefiel, vice president, and general manager of Agilent\\'s Mass Spectrometry Division. \"These new products offer customers workflow solutions that maximize sample throughput and stability, as well as greater reliability than ever before.\"\\n\\nThe 6470B system includes enhancements that boost system uptime and improve overall system performance for low-level detection in routine, high-throughput environments. Customers running a single chromatographic method for applications such as multi-residue screening will see greater data fidelity, reproducibility, and sensitivity. The system integrates seamlessly into existing analytical labs and customer workflows—and it offers quicker routine maintenance through the addition of VacShield technology, designed to easily remove ion injectors without venting.\\n\\nThe high-throughput RapidFire 400 integrated autosampler provides fast results with cycle times as short as 2 sec/sample and adds optional sample cooling for greater sample stability. The system includes barcode reading capabilities for sample tracking, now supports 1,536 well plates, and allows unattended operation for the analysis of more than 98,000 samples. It is further designed to integrate with the Ultivo LC/TQ system, further reducing lab space requirements.\\n\\nAbout Agilent Technologies\\n\\nAgilent Technologies Inc.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

And they upped a stake of Restaurant Brands International QSR, -1.29% QSR, -1.29% , owner of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s, by more than 50%. Pershing Square said as budget-conscious consumers trade down due to the pandemic, they’ll head to cheaper eateries like those.\\n\\nPershing is sticking to fast-food chain Chipotle CMG, -0.77% for its “fortress balance sheet” and zero debt. Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, -3.13% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +0.26% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, -1.05% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +3.64% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis. On the upside, people still value homeownership now, said Ackman.\\n\\nThe chart\\n\\nThis Goldman Sachs chart shows the recovering, but bumpy trajectory for China consumer activity — includes hotels, movie, theater, retail sales, airline seat miles — post pandemic, versus the U.S., where it is obviously deeply depressed.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing. Americans are expected to move more freely over the coming long Memorial Day holiday weekend that signals the start of summer.\\n\\nRead now: States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: More beaches, casinos open ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend\\n\\nIt also comes as an ABC News/Ispos poll found that just 39% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, the lowest reading for the president since the poll started to track sentiment in March.\\n\\nA Fox News poll published on Thursday found just 44% of those polled approve of Trump’s performance, down from 49% in April. The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co. F, +6.13% plant that has switched production to make ventilators and masks. Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic. They have been regularly touted by President Donald Trump, who said this week that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine. A number of clinical trials are underway evaluating the medications as both a treatment or a prophylactic for those at high-risk of contracting the virus.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThere are now 5.24 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and at least 338,762 people have died, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.

A.B. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, echoing the concerns of other analysts on the conference call, expressed wariness over what he called another “significant multi-year effort” by HPE to slash costs.

BABA, -0.26% , which offered a first look at how China is faring as it comes out of lockdown.\\n\\nElsewhere, companies continued to issue debt and equity, and to update investors and customers on their reopening plans.\\n\\nRead: ‘The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating’: Americans brace for another coronavirus outbreak in the fall\\n\\nHere are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Agilent Technologies Inc. A, +0.71% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +8.04% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +2.24% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.08% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -1.17% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +1.19% UAA, +1.06% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our \"building and buying\" strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

For the three and six months ended April 30, 2020, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15.5%. For the three months ended April 30, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.48%. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.75%. We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, NASD site costs, special compliance costs and tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer. Asset impairments include assets that have been written down to their fair value. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers including costs to move manufacturing due to new tariffs and tariff remediation actions, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system, human resources and financial systems. Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as data privacy regulations, revenue recognition, lease accounting and certain tax reporting requirements. Other includes certain legal costs and settlements and unrealized gains related to our equity securities in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments. Tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer relates to our operations in Singapore along with our application of the new accounting rules for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of assets as adopted on November 1, 2018. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results \"through the eyes\" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information. Page 4\\n\\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business. Also, growth of the API business should have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative product launches is expected to have aided its performance.\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Agilent this time around.

       "   'title': 'Can Amazon Solve the Covid-19 Testing Challenge?',\n",
       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nAmazon. com has successfully invaded many different businesses—but Covid-19 testing? The company said during its recent earnings call that it expects to spend $4 billion or more in the second quarter responding to the pandemic. Among other things, it is spending “hundreds of millions to develop our own Covid-19 testing capabilities.”\\n\\nThis news has Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wondering if Amazon might evolve into a major Covid-19 testing player. “We believe the goal is to create Covid-19 testing stations that Amazon employees can pass through on a daily basis,” Nowak writes in a note. “Amazon expects to spend $1 billion on this initiative between April and the end of 2020.”\\n\\nNowak believes Amazon will work on a rapid saliva test. He’s upbeat, despite many unmet promises around testing and Amazon’s lack of experience. He ticks off three challenges, which, he says, play to its strengths. One is supply chain. “The tests will need to be produced in massive quantities and manufacturing capacity built quickly,” he writes. The second is optimization of a test likely to struggle with efficiency and accuracy. The third is capital; Amazon is flush.\\n\\nWhy would Amazon want to get into testing? Nowak, who has an Overweight rating and a $2,600 target price for the stock, argues that employee and customer safety could become a competitive edge in e-commerce. “The potential public goodwill created through [sharing] this cannot be valued, and in a world where tech regulation is a recurring topic, could be a game changer,” he writes.\\n\\nAmazon itself is playing things down. “We’re not sure how far we will get in the relevant time frame, but we think it’s worth trying,” Amazon said.\\n\\nThis Week\\n\\nMonday 5/18\\n\\nThe World Health Organization holds its 73rd World Health Assembly. The 194 member states of the WHO will discuss the Covid-19 pandemic response during the two-day meeting.\\n\\nBaidu reports first-quarter results.\\n\\nThe National Association of Home Builders releases its NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index for May. Consensus estimates are for a 34.5 reading, up from April’s 30 figure. The April reading was the first below 50 since 2014, and the lowest since 2012, when the industry was recovering from the housing crash.\\n\\nTuesday 5/19\\n\\nAdvance Auto Parts, Home Depot, and Walmart report earnings.\\n\\nAmgen, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Halliburton, and JPMorgan Chase hold their annual meetings of shareholders.\\n\\nThe Census Bureau reports new residential construction data for April.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose above 71,000 on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump appeared to back off his announcement that he would phase out the government task force created to manage the pandemic.\\n\\nTrump said on a visit to Arizona on Tuesday that he would be winding down the task force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence and includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, another public-health expert who is White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted that the force would continue its work indefinitely, although it may add or subtract members over time as it refocuses on reopening the economy, along with vaccines and therapeutics.\\n\\nTrump has been pushing to reopen an economy that all but closed down amid stay-at-home orders from governors seeking to contain the spread and avoid overwhelming hospitals and health-care workers. The president has tweeted support for protesters in states including Michigan against restrictions on movement.\\n\\nDemocrats had criticized the plan to wind down the task force, given the U.S. is still seeing increases in case numbers and deaths. Trump acknowledged that reopening would possibly result in more deaths but said, “we can’t sit in the house for the next three years.”\\n\\nA group of young volunteers recruited by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner that was tasked with securing personal protective equipment, or PPE, for frontline workers were told to prioritize tips from political allies and associates of the president, the New York Times reported.\\n\\nCiting emails and documents obtained by their reporters, the paper said few of the leads actually panned out and the volunteers, who had no experience in procurement, were confused and overwhelmed by the task. PPE has been in short supply across the U.S. since the start of the outbreak and is reported to have contributed to infections among health-care and other medical workers.\\n\\nRead: Your genes could determine whether coronavirus puts you in the hospital — and we’re starting to unravel which ones matter\\n\\nIn the U.K., a scientist and top government adviser on the pandemic resigned after he was caught breaking lockdown rules. Prof. Neil Ferguson quit the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment,” as the Guardian reported. The move came after a Daily Telegraph report revealed that Ferguson’s lover had crossed London to visit him at least twice after lockdown measures were implemented.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThe U.K.’s case tally crossed 200,000 on Wednesday and it now has the highest death toll in Europe, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K. has 202,355 cases and 30,150 deaths, putting its death toll ahead of Italy’s, which was an early hot spot. Official numbers from the U.K. have a slightly different tally.\\n\\nThere are 3.71 million cases of COVID-19 globally and 259,695 people have died. At least 1.2 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case toll at 1.21 million and the highest death toll at 71,463.\\n\\nSpain has the highest number of cases in Europe at 219,329 and 25,613 deaths. Italy has 214,457 cases and 29,684 deaths.\\n\\nFrance has 170,694 cases and 25,538 deaths. Germany has 167,372 cases and 6,993 deaths.\\n\\nRussia has 165,929 cases and 1,537 deaths after another big spike in infections overnight. Turkey has 131,744 cases and 3,584 deaths, followed by Brazil with 116,299 cases and 7,966 deaths. Iran has 101,650 cases and 6,418 deaths. China, where the disease was first reported late last year, has 83,968 cases and 4,637 deaths.\\n\\nWhat’s the latest medical news?\\n\\nAdaptive Biotechnologies Corp. US:ADPT has launched a virtual clinical study with Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT aimed at better understanding the immune response in 1,000 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus.\\n\\nThe study will use diagnostic tests made by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings US:LH, who will send employees to the participants’ homes to collect the samples, which will then be used to examine patients’ T-cells.

Mid-size companies, defined as having 50 to 499 workers, shed 5.3 million jobs, large businesses with 500 employees or more axed 8.9 million jobs.\\n\\nHealth-care jobs were not immune as the pandemic causes a steep decline in treatments for non-virus conditions and the postponement of elective procedures, the data show. Health-care companies cut almost a million jobs.

US:DIS said profit fell more than 90% in its fiscal second quarter, as parks were ordered to close, film production stalled and TV advertising was disrupted. Disney has faced some of the biggest fears from Wall Street about its business during the coronavirus crisis, as its largest units are centered around on-premise interactions that have been shut down during shelter-in-place orders: Theme parks and cruise lines, movies and live sports, for example.\\n\\nAnalysts said the company’s release prompted more questions than answers and criticized the lack of detail on what lies ahead on the earnings call.\\n\\n“Of course we did not expect Disney to opine on timing of openings for Parks, theaters, sports, or content production,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote. “However, we had hoped for better clarity on Parks burn rate when closed, margin profile when opened at reduced capacity, operating rules/implications/parameters for operating in a pre-vaccine world.”\\n\\nFor more, see:Disney earnings leave more questions than answers as COVID-19 pressures theme parks and more\\n\\nThere was better news from videogame makers Activision Blizzard Inc. US:ATVI and Electronic Arts Inc. US:EA, which both reported healthy increases in sales and profit as Americans sheltering in place switched to the virtual world for entertainment.\\n\\nThe companies don’t expect much change: EA predicted profits this quarter would triple from the year before to more than a quarter-billion dollars, while Activision forecast adjusted profit of more than $500 million, a 67% increase.\\n\\nSee also:Videogames are flourishing in the pandemic, and game makers aren’t scared of the future\\n\\nBeyond Meat Inc. US:BYND said disruption in the meat supply chain as facilities with infected worker are forced to close has been a boost to its lineup of meat substitutes and plant-based products. Beyond Meat reported fiscal first-quarter results that blew past Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 7% in extended trading. Shares have surged 85% since March 18, as retailers request “expedited” deliveries to refill shelves across the country, a company spokesperson said.\\n\\nRival Impossible Foods, which is privately held for now, also reported business that was “full steam ahead.”\\n\\nFor more, read:Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat see spike in demand as coronavirus wreaks havoc on meat supply\\n\\nGeneral Motors Co. US:GM delivered another surprise with the car maker beating expectations for profit and revenue despite the steep slowdown in car sales during the pandemic.\\n\\nHere’s the latest things companies are saying about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. US:A has started to reopen stores that were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic in those locations where regulations allow it. “We are optimistic for the future and we’re happy to announce that we have begun to open select stores globally on a rolling basis and will continue to do so in the weeks ahead,” Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said in a regulatory filing. “We will open stores as State and local regulations allow and as we are able to meet the applicable safety and health standards.”\\n\\n• Bunge Ltd. US:BG reported a surprise first-quarter loss, revenue that fell below expectations and provided a downbeat full-year outlook, saying that while it didn’t experience a significant disruption to its business from the pandemic, it did start to see the negative impact of a change in consumer behavior in its edible oils business in March. “Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,” said Chief Executive Greg Heckman. The company said it expects 2020 EPS to be lower than its original expectation.\\n\\n• CVS Health Corp. US:CVS reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, as its pharmacy and retail business got a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pharmacy businesses benefited from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19-related lockdowns. CVS affirmed its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is above the current FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• General Motors reported first-quarter profit and revenue that fell, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to suspended operations, but beat expectations as U.S. truck sales rose sharply. GM’s U.S. sales fell 7%, driven by the negative effects of the pandemic, but sales of full-size pickups rose 27%, with market share increasing to 41%. Among actions GM has taken to preserve cash during the pandemic include suspension of its dividend and share repurchases, salary cuts and drawing on its credit facilities.\\n\\n• Office Depot Inc. US:ODP posted first-quarter earnings that blew past estimates. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Office Depot had liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end, its highest net cash position in two years. “Our B2B focus is helping businesses remain operational in the home or at the office, our facilities have largely remained open serving customers with enhanced sanitation and safety protocols, and our e-commerce platform and retail stores are proving to be trusted means for customers to access the critical products and services they need,” Chief Executive Gerry Smith said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 2% in the quarter and e-commerce sales saw a strong jump in demand, he said. The company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance given the uncertainty around the pandemic and is suspending temporarily its share buybacks and dividend payments. Separately, it announced that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to block any party from taking advantage of a falling share price to build a stake in the company.\\n\\n• Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. US:SPR swung to a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter on revenue that fell less than forecast. The suspension of Boeing Co’s US:BA production of the 737 MAX plane led to lower margins as given “abnormal” costs associated with the pandemic. Actions the company has taken to preserve liquidity and cut costs amid the 737 MAX groundings and the COVID-19 pandemic include cutting the dividend, suspending share buybacks, deferring repayments of an advance from Boeing and cutting jobs and work schedules. The company will not provide 2020 financial guidance given the continued uncertainties surrounding the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic.\\n\\n• United Airlines Inc. US:UAL is offering $2.25 billion in senior secured notes in a private offering. The bonds will be offered in two tranches maturing in 2023 and 2025. Proceeds of the deal will be used to repay a $2.0 billion term loan entered into in March and for general corporate purposes. Airlines have been tapping credit lines and government relief plans with most fleets grounded during the pandemic.\\n\\n• Wendy’s Co. US:WEN reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. Wendy’s had a cash balance of $365 million as of May 3 after fully drawing down its revolving financing facility, reducing its second-quarter dividend and taking other measures due to the pandemic. Nearly all (96%) of Wendy’s restaurants are operating, including 99% in the U.S., with drive-through and delivery only. Wendy’s has said that disruptions to the beef supply chain has put limits on the availability of certain menu items.',\n",

       "   'title': \"Agilent Technologies, Inc. -- Moody's assigns P-2 rating to Agilent's new commercial paper program, affirms Baa2 rating, outlook stable\",\n",
       "   'text': 'NOTE: On May 05, 2020, the press release was corrected as follows: In the debt list, for Agilent Technologies, Inc., under “Outlook action” was changed to “Maintained, Stable.” Revised release follows.\\n\\nNew York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody\\'s Investors Service, (\"Moody\\'s) assigned a P-2 short term rating to Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\'s (\"Agilent\") new $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Concurrently, Moody\\'s affirmed the Baa2 senior unsecured rating. The outlook is stable.\\n\\nThe new $1.0 billion program is supported by Agilent\\'s $1.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring March 2024. Moody\\'s anticipates that Agilent will not issue more under its CP program than is available under its revolving credit facility at any given time, to maintain full back-stop under the program. The credit agreement has no material adverse change clause or material adverse event language related to litigation that would restrict borrowings. The revolver has same-day availability for US borrowings.\\n\\nThe P-2 rating reflects Agilent\\'s excellent liquidity, the company had $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash at January 31, 2020, offset by approximately $675 million of short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt. Agilent has full availability under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The revolver contains financial maintenance covenants. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is currently set at 3.5x, and Moody\\'s expects the company will maintain ample cushion under the leverage covenant.\\n\\nThe rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, the deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The life science tools and services sector has been one of the sectors adversely affected by the shock.\\n\\nMore specifically, Agilent will be impacted by the temporary closure of some research labs, deferral of customers\\' spending on expensive capital equipment and reduced demand from certain economically sensitive industrial and applied end-markets. Further, reduced physician visits and the deferral of healthcare services will also negatively impact demand for certain clinical diagnostics products. Moody\\'s regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, the affirmation of the Baa2 rating reflects Moody\\'s views that Agilent is well positioned at the current Baa2 rating. This reflects the company\\'s strong market positions, diversification both in terms of geographies and end-markets, and conservative financial policies -- as evidenced by leverage that is modest for the Baa2 rating. Further, Agilent has taken steps to adjust its cost base and manage cash conservatively, which includes the suspension of its share buyback program.\\n\\nMoody\\'s took the following rating actions for Agilent Technologies Inc.:\\n\\nAssignments:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\n....Commercial Paper, Assigned P-2\\n\\nRatings affirmed:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nSenior unsecured, at Baa2\\n\\nOutlook action:\\n\\nMaintained, Stable\\n\\nRATINGS RATIONALE\\n\\nThe Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating reflects Agilent\\'s favorable scale, strong competitive positions, attractive growth prospects across key markets, good customer and geographic diversification, moderate leverage, and excellent liquidity. Agilent\\'s ratings also reflect Moody\\'s expectations that the company will maintain conservative financial policies with debt/EBITDA approaching 2.0x in the next 12-18 months. The company\\'s rating is constrained by a relatively high reliance on revenue generated from the sale of expensive equipment used in analytical laboratories. This increases Agilent\\'s sensitivity to economic cycles.\\n\\nReflecting the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the lost business days by the customers of life science companies such as Agilent will temporarily reduce the demand for certain consumable products. Further, some equipment purchases will be delayed. The company\\'s operations, products and services are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for handling, storing and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. An inability to adhere to such standards could result in financial penalties and remediation costs. However, the company applies strict standards for the protection of the environment and occupational health, and high safety standards that help mitigate this risk. Agilent maintains a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. In terms of governance, the company has a track record of maintaining low financial leverage and ample liquidity.\\n\\nThe stable outlook reflects Moody\\'s view that Agilent will maintain its strong market leadership, remain well diversified, and maintain conservative financial policies.\\n\\nFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS\\n\\nRatings could be upgraded if the company is able to generate higher levels of recurring revenue relative to total sales and further strengthens operating performance. Quantitatively, ratings could be upgraded if debt/EBITDA was sustained below 2.0 times.\\n\\nRatings could be downgraded in the event of significant market share erosion, or severe contraction in its key markets. Ratings could also be downgraded in the event of a large debt financed acquisition or shareholder distribution. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if debt to EBITDA was sustained above 3.0 times.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agilent Technologies, Inc.

       "   'text': 'COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified late last year in Wuhan, China, was a dominant theme in the earnings releases and conference calls of S&P 500 companies in the recent earnings season as investors press for answers on how it will impact their financials.\\n\\nThere are now more than 101,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 3,400 deaths, according to a tally of cases published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Centers for Systems Science and Engineering.\\n\\nWith the December earnings season now all but over, many companies are having to review their guidance to incorporate the effect the virus is having on supply chains in Asia, as well as on consumer behavior across the globe. While most companies are still saying it’s too early to assess the full impact, many are attempting to offer some evaluation of lost sales or hits to earnings.\\n\\nThis is what companies have been saying:\\n\\n• 3M Co. US:MMM said demand for respirators is currently outpacing supply, and that increased demand for respirators during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 generated $250 million in revenue for the company. “That’s maybe the best frame to think about it for coronavirus at this point,” CEO Mike Roman said at an investor conference.\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. US:ANF expects an adverse impact of $60 million to $80 million on sales this year as a result of the outbreak. It has also lost $4 million “primarily from store closures in mainland China due to the coronavirus.” Abercrombie’s Asia-Pacific region made up less than 10% of 2019 sales, and its total manufacturing exposure to China was 22% in fiscal 2019. “We’ve given ourselves some provision I guess I would say on the European tourism business to continue to suffer a little bit as the travel restrictions get more and more intense,” CFO Scott Lipesky said during an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Agilent Techonologies Inc. US:A expects earnings of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion “after factoring in the potential impact” of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. “Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,” CFO Robert McMahon said. “This reduced the number of shipping days in China.”\\n\\nRead also:Consumer-facing companies will be the first hit if the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\\n\\n• Alcoa Corp. US:AA, which makes aluminum products, said it is seeing supply chain bottlenecks in China for bauxite, caustic and coal gas that are lowering production. “It’s driving a shortage of alumina inside of China, which is then starting to see the Chinese alumina price increase and you see the knock-on impact in the rest of the world with prices also increasing, pricing up by about $20 per ton over these last few weeks,” CEO Roy Harvey told investors.\\n\\n• American Airlines Group Inc. US:AAL is reducing international and domestic capacity through the summer peak season as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The airline is cutting international capacity by 10%, including a 55% reduction in trans-Pacific capacity. In the U.S., the airline is cutting capacity by 7.5% in April.\\n\\n• Analog Devices Inc. US:ADI updated its guidance for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. “While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Apple Inc. US:AAPL is not expecting to meet second-quarter financial guidance because production has slowed or been halted in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Apple generates about 15% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there.\\n\\nRead also: Apple’s coronavirus warning wasn’t a total surprise, but magnitude rattles Wall Street\\n\\n• Best Buy Inc. US:BBY, which sources a lot of its consumer electronics products from China, said it assumes that most of the impact from the coronavirus will happen during the first half of the year. “Therefore, we view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said in a statement. “Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimates of the impacts at this time.” On the company’s earnings call, executives stressed that it was still a fluid situation and they are attempting to gauge when factories will be fully back up and running and whether global vendors have sufficient inventory.\\n\\n• Boston Scientific Corp. US:BSX, which has a $600 million business in China, is expecting a “negative first-half impact” on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. The company lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a “preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.”\\n\\n• Brown-Forman Corp. US:BF, the parent company of the Jack Daniel’s whiskey brand, lowered guidance to reflect global uncertainty and the effect of the coronavirus. The company is now expecting full-year earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.80, below the $1.82 FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• Capri Holdings Ltd. US:CPRI, which owns luxury brands Jimmy Choo and Versace, said it now expects annual revenue of $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50 as the virus eats into sales. That’s below the FactSet consensus for revenue of $5.78 billion and per-share earnings of $4.87.\\n\\nRead also:How much will COVID-19 hurt the U.S. economy? It’s anyone’s guess right now\\n\\n• Carnival Corp. US:CCL said there could be a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share impact of 55 cents to 65 cents if all operations are suspended in Asia through the end of April. If that comes to pass, according to Carnival, there would be a material impact on the business from suspended cruises in Chinese ports; cancellations in other parts of Asia; and the impact on bookings, which is determined by the length of time that an event influences travel.\\n\\n• The Coca-Cola Company US:KO said it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola’s global volume, the company said in January. “China’s economy was in a different place when SARS happened,” CEO James Quincey said in January. “It’s worth noting that China’s economy is [now] much bigger, and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.” In its 10-K filing with the SEC, the company also said it has seen delays in the production and export of ingredients used in nonnutritive sweeteners. It doesn’t expect a hit to its full-year results for now.\\n\\n• Crocs Inc. US:CROX expects first-quarter revenue to be hurt by $20 million to $30 million due to disruptions in Asia from the coronavirus. The casual shoe maker said many of its sellers in China remain closed, with those that are open seeing reduced operating hours and traffic, with traffic declines expanding throughout Asia.\\n\\n• Delta Air Lines Inc. US:DAL is reducing capacity by 15 points, implementing a hiring freeze, offering voluntary leave, and deferring spending as it struggles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The airline said it is cutting international capacity by 20% to 25% and domestic capacity by 10% to 15%.\\n\\n• Dollar General Inc. US:DG is “strongly encouraging” that the first hour of store operations be dedicated solely for senior shoppers, who are the most vulnerable to infection. “Dollar General wants to provide these at-risk customers with the ability to purchase the items they need and want at the beginning of each day to avoid busier and more crowded shopping periods,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Domino’s Pizza Inc. US:DPZ said that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino’s opened 80 net new stores in China.\\n\\n• Dow Inc. US:DOW expects the coronavirus to shave about $400 million off first-quarter sales, after business in China saw a 20% to 30% dip in sales. CFO Howard Ungerleider told an industrials conference that the chemicals company expects some additional sales impact, but that it is difficult to quantify for now. “However, if I had to size the total impact of COVID on our first quarter based on what I know today, both the impact in China and the knock-on impacts around the world, I would arrange the total impact to the Dow in the first quarter in the $200 million range on Ebitda,” the executive told attendees, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. US:DNKN has limited service to drive-through, carryout and delivery, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coffee and doughnut seller will remove tables and chairs from all its restaurants and outdoor patios to prevent the congregation of customers.\\n\\n• Ecolab Inc. US:ECL, a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. “If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,” he said, on an earnings call. “Before that, it didn’t exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.”\\n\\n• Eli Lilly and Co. US:LLY doesn’t expect any shortages of medicine, including insulin, as a result of the coronavirus. The company has been monitoring its supply chain for potential impact, and doesn’t source active pharmaceutical ingredients from China and insulin manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe have not been affected.\\n\\n• The Estée Lauder Cos. US:EL said the third quarter will be most impacted by the sales decline of luxury beauty products in China. The company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase of up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\n• Expedia Group Inc. US:EXPE is expecting a $30 million to $40 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. It also expects “some impact beyond [the first quarter] in 2020 as well,” CEO Barry Diller told investors. “But the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize.”\\n\\n• Exxon Mobil Corp. US:XOM is “looking to significantly reduce spending” in the near-term as a result of market conditions caused by the pandemic and commodity price decreases. “We will outline plans when they are finalized,” CEO Darren Woods said in a statement.\\n\\n• Foot Locker Inc. US:FL has closed stores across North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia and Malaysia through March 31. The athletic retailer has also withdrawn its full-year outlook and plans to provide an update with its first-quarter earnings announcement on May 22.\\n\\n• Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. US:FDP CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn’t expect the outbreak to fade away before April. “Usually these viruses, they don’t subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,” Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\\n\\n• General Electric Co. US:GE expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 13 cents, and negative free cash flow of about $2 billion. GE said while COVID-19 is an “evolving variable,” it currently expects a negative impact on first-quarter free cash flow of about $300 million to $500 million, and on operating income of $200 million to $300 million. The impacts are included in GE’s 2020 outlook.\\n\\n• General Mills Inc. US:GIS said half of its Häagen-Dazs shops in greater China are closed, and the shops that remain open have “severely restricted hours.” Greater China makes up 4% of General Mills’ net sales, 40% of its sales in the region are at Häagen-Dazs shops and other restaurants. The company told investors it can’t yet share how the closures will affect its numbers for fiscal 2020.\\n\\n• Gilead Sciences Inc. US:GILD is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for people with the new coronavirus. The drug maker plans to conduct a randomized, controlled trial in China as part of those plans, saying that remdesivir has shown “in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens” Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS, both of which are also coronaviruses.\\n\\n• Hasbro Inc. US:HAS continues “to have office and third-party factory closures” in China as a result of the outbreak. The company said that China is responsible for about two-thirds of its global sourcing. “The biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up,” said Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas. “Travel is limited, [and] places are still closed.”\\n\\n• Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. US:HPE told investors it no longer expects revenue to grow in fiscal 2020, with one executive telling MarketWatch that he blames a 16% year-over-year decline in compute revenue ($3 billion) and 9% decline in total revenue on “microenvironment” issues such as supply-chain disruption and the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. US:HLT said about 150 hotels, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms, are closed in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• Hormel Foods Corp. US:HRL expects its international business to have a “very difficult” second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. “Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,” CEO James Snee told investors.\\n\\n• HP Inc. US:HPQ said it expects a “negative impact to our top line, bottom line and [free cash flow],” citing delayed production and manufacturing timelines. The technology giant said when taking into account the outbreak, it now anticipates earnings per share of 46 cents to 50 cents and adjusted EPS of 49 cents to 53 cents.\\n\\n• HSBC Holdings PLC US:HSBC expects a weaker first-half performance in 2020, due to the downturn in Hong Kong and virus-related credit losses in the first quarter, it said. “The most extreme downside scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year,” an executive said on an earnings call. “If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional loan losses provisions required.”\\n\\n• InterContinental Hotels Group PLC US:IHG said 160 hotels are closed in China or closed to new guests. The company’s fee business is expected to take a $5 million hit in February in China, as a result of the outbreak. Its Chinese operations make up less than 10% of group operating profit. CEO Keith Barr told investors that the postponement and cancellation of conferences will have an impact on its operations, too. “What I saw during H1N1 and other times in China, the key thing to remember is the Chinese government’s ability to stimulate economic growth and activity is unlike any other country,” he said, on an earnings call.\\n\\n• Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. US:IPG and Meredith Corp. US:MDP separately told investors that the advertising is seeing a small slowdown. “We’ve seen a slight pullback in luxury advertising related to the travel category, a couple of airlines, not domestic airlines, but actually international airlines pulled back a little bit,” Meredith’s CEO Thomas Harty said at an investor conference. IPG’s Michael Roth said at the same event that the ad giant has “seen cutbacks before on the project side of the business.” He also noted that the temporary move to a work-from-home culture may lead to additional business. “Clients are going to need our expertise in allocating media dollars where the clients are, whether they’re working at home or whether the consumers are working at home, and how you address the marketplace that’s different,” he said.\\n\\nSee:Coronavirus is disrupting tech conferences across the globe — what to know\\n\\n• IQVIA Inc. US:IQV, which runs clinical trials, including in China, said it expects a $25 million impact in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. “The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China because that’s kind of the more dangerous spot right now,” CEO Ari Bousbib told investors.\\n\\n• ITT Inc. US:ITT updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\\n\\n• JetBlue Airways Corp. US:JBLU said it will halt change and cancel fees for new flight bookings starting Thursday through March 11 for travel completed by June 1. “The policy is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns,” the airline said in a statement. The move will apply to all fares offered by JetBlue, including its cheapest fares, which generally do not allow for any changes or cancellations.\\n\\n• Johnson & Johnson US:JNJ expects a “modest impact” on sales of its skin care products as “people [are] buying less.\\n\\n• Lands’ End Inc. US:LE said the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in lower customer demand over the past week, and that it will not provide guidance for fiscal 2020 given the “rapidly changing business environment.”\\n\\n• L Brands Inc. US:LB closed all Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works stores in the U.S. and Canada through March 29 due to the pandemic. It also withdrew its guidance for the first quarter.\\n\\n• Lululemon Athletica Inc. US:LULU said that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3.

US:LYFT reported its “biggest week in our history in terms of both revenue and rides,” potentially driven by fear of the contracting the coronavirus on public transportation, CFO Brian Roberts said at a technology summit.\\n\\n• Marriott International Inc. US:MAR said while it could not “fully estimate the financial impact” from COVID-19, it would be “material to first quarter and full-year 2020 results.”\\n\\n• Mastercard Inc. US:MA said it expects to shave 2 to 3 percentage points from its first-quarter revenue guidance because of the impact of COVID-19 on “cross-border travel and, to a lesser extent, cross-border e-commerce growth.”\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC US:MDT told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\nWhat It’s Like for Cruise Ship Passengers During Coronavirus Outbreak\\n\\n• Michaels Companies Inc. US:MIK gave guidance ahead of expectations but that didn’t take into account the impact of the coronavirus. Mark Cosby, Michaels CEO, said the company doesn’t expect “material supply chain disruptions” in the first quarter but sales in certain categories are slowing.\\n\\n• Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT warned that it will not meet guidance for its fiscal third quarter due to COVID-19. Microsoft in late January guided for fiscal third-quarter sales for its More Personal Computing segment of $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion, which “included a wider-than-usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.” While there’s “strong” demand for Windows in line with the company’s expectations, the supply chain “is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. All other components of its Q3 guidance remain unchanged, Microsoft said.\\n\\n• Mondelēz Inc. US:MDLZ told investors to expect “an impact on both revenue and margins” as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. “I’m quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don’t see at this point,” CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\\n\\n• Nike Inc. US:NKE has closed about half its stores in China, while the remaining stores are reporting lower-than-expected retail traffic. The athletic-apparel maker said it plans to provide an update about the impact of the virus on its third-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n• Nordstrom Inc. US:JWN closed its U.S. and Canadian stores, including Nordstrom full-line, Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club clubhouses and Jeffrey, for two weeks. The company’s online business, which accounted for one-third of sales in 2019, will remain in business. The company also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance offered on March 3, which didn’t include the impact of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. US:NCLH expects the virus to shave off 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia — that’s 40 total — through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\\n\\n• OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. US:OSW, which provides on-board spa services to cruises, said in an earnings statement that it expects to lose $5 million in revenue and $2 million in adjusted EBITDA as a result of 141 canceled or modified voyages and lower revenue at its resort spas in Asia.\\n\\n• ON Semiconductor Corp. US:ON issued a revenue warning for the first quarter, due to the change in business conditions being created by the coronavirus. The Apple supplier now expects revenue to range from $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, compared with prior guidance of $1.355 billion to $1.405 billion, issued on Feb. 3. “We saw soft order trends in China in the weeks following Lunar New Year holidays, but orders have since picked up, and we have not seen any significant cancellations of orders,” CEO Keith Jackson said in a statement.\\n\\n• L’Oréal US:LRLCY said the impact from the outbreak will be temporary, based on the cosmetics maker’s experience with the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. What is different about this outbreak, however, is L’Oréal’s e-commerce sales of beauty products in China are stronger so far in February than they were this month last year. “This crisis will even strengthen the position of the e-commerce players in China,” CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors at an analyst conference.\\n\\n• Papa John’s International Inc. US:PZZA said it has closed about 50 franchised stores in China as a result of the outbreak. Although the pizza company said the impact of the store closures isn’t currently material to its earnings, uncertainty about the spread of the virus could “lead to lower sales [and] widespread store closures or delays in our supply chain, which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results.”\\n\\n• PayPal Holdings Inc. US:PYPL expects the coronavirus to have a negative revenue impact of 1 percentage point for the March quarter and is expecting revenue for the quarter to fall toward the low end of its guidance of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion. “Stronger performance quarter-to-date across our diversified business is partially offsetting this one percentage point negative impact,” PayPal said.\\n\\n• Procter & Gamble Co. US:PG expects the outbreak to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant’s second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\\n\\n• PVH Corp. US:PVH, owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, said that 20% of its global sourcing comes from greater China, which also made up 7% of its 2019 revenue. Most PVH-owned stores in China remain closed. Still, the company reaffirmed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $1.79 for the fourth quarter and at least $9.45 for the full year.\\n\\n• Qorvo Inc. US:QRVO cut its revenue outlook, citing the estimated impact the coronavirus outbreak is having on the smartphone supply chain.

US:RL said fiscal 2020 sales could be hurt by up to $70 million and operating income in Asia could take a $35 million to $45 million hit as a result of the outbreak. Two-thirds of the luxury retailer’s mainland China stores have been closed for a week, and about half of its stores were closed another week.\\n\\nSee:Large wave of new diagnoses said to have harmed confidence in China\\n\\n• Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. US:RCL canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries as a result of the virus. The cruise-line operator said it expects an impact of 65 cents per share on its 2020 financial performance. If it has to cancel cruises in Asia through April, doing so would impact the company’s 2020 financial performance by an additional 55 cents a share.\\n\\n• Sabre Corp. US:SABR said the coronavirus will have a “material impact” on its 2020 results, as the outbreak has weighed on travel bookings so far this year. The company said the estimated impact for the first quarter of earnings per share of 14 cents to 23 cents and for revenue of $100 million to $150 million.\\n\\n• Sanderson Farms Inc. US:SAFM said the outbreak of African swine fever in China should eventually boost the poultry market in the U.S., but COVID-19 is now disrupting markets in China, depressing demand, hurting shipping and supply chain logistics and slowing China’s economic growth rate. The chicken meat producer said the Chinese lifting of the ban on chicken from the U.S. had led to orders for about 18 million pounds of chicken products.\\n\\n• Skechers USA Inc. US:SKX said the impact of COVID-19 had worsened since it last updated investors when it reported earnings on Feb. 6. Skechers offered guidance at that time for first-quarter sales of $1.400 billion to $1.425 billion, and earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents. “Things definitely have deteriorated to a degree,” CFO John Vandemore told investors at a UBS conference. He also said the big change is now coming in European countries that have experienced clusters of the illness, with Italy closing schools and universities.\\n\\n• Southwest Airlines Co. US:LUV CEO Gary Kelly told employees that he will take a 10% pay cut, as the company faces the worst downturn in decades as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\n• Spirit Airlines Inc. US:SAVE told investors they shouldn’t rely on its 2020 financial guidance given the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The discount air carrier said at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference that it has seen “significant pressure” on fares since the end of February and “modest” pressure on load factor.\\n\\n• Stanley Black & Decker Inc. US:SWK expects the outbreak to “cause some pressure for us in March and April from a revenue perspective,” according to remarks made by CFO Donald Allan at an investor conference. The company generates about $250 million in annual revenue in China and runs 10 plants there, which are operating at about 50% to 60% capacity, as of last week.\\n\\n• Starbucks Corp. US:SBUX, the Seattle-based coffee chain, said it was already “showing early signs of recovery” in China and that U.S. sales are still strong despite the coronavirus. “To date, there are no perceptible signs of COVID-19 impact on our U.S. business, which accounted for approximately 65% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020,” the coffee chain said in a financial filing. The company’s shareholder meeting will be “virtual only” this year due to the coronavirus.\\n\\n• TripAdvisor Inc. US:TRIP said it may see a low-single-digit percentage impact on its financial results. “We do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we’re not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business,” CEO Stephen Kaufer told analysts.\\n\\n• Tyson Foods Inc. US:TSN has restarted some operations in China, but CEO Noel White said the company will face short-term impacts from the outbreak, even if the fallout eventually helps support government efforts in China to “decrease” the number of wet markets. Researchers believe that the virus, common to bats, may have been transmitted to humans via another animal sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan. “We’ll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China,” White said. “The combination of [African swine fever] and coronavirus would expedite that transition.”\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. US:UA expects to lose between $50 million and $60 million in sales to the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• United Airlines Holdings Inc. US:UAL rescinded its annual revenue guidance for 2020, saying the outbreak is too unpredictable to ensure that the forecast it issued two months ago will hold up. The airline will cut flight capacity by 10% domestically and 20% internationally in April due to the coronavirus outbreak. Executives Oscar Munoz and Scott Kirby will forego their base salaries, effective immediately through June 30, and the company has withdrawn its first-quarter guidance. Net bookings to Asia and Europe are down 100%; the company’s “dire scenario planning assumption” is that revenue will be down 70% in April and May. In comparison, demand was down 40% for the two months following 9/11. Kirby said he expects to recover demand within 18 months.\\n\\n• Urban Outfitters Inc.’s US:URBN store traffic and sales fell over the past week in cities including Milan and Seattle where the coronavirus is having a heavy impact. Other cities have been affected as well. The company, which also operates Anthropologie and Free People, said it can’t forecast how the company will be impacted in the first quarter because of the uncertainty around the outbreak.\\n\\n• Vail Resorts Inc. US:MTN said earnings and revenue were lower than analysts expected and rescinded its annual guidance as it sees business declining. “In the week ended March 8, 2020, we saw a marked negative change in performance from the prior week, with destination skier visits modestly below expectations,” Chief Executive Rob Katz said in a news release. “We expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in upcoming weeks.”\\n\\n• VF Corp. US:VFC, which owns the sneaker brand Vans, has closed 60% of its owned and partner stores in China. The shops that have remained open are reporting “significant” declines in retail traffic.\\n\\n• ViacomCBS Inc. US:VIAC is delaying the release of the “Sonic the Hedgehog” move in some Asian markets because of the outbreak, while MGM and Universal Studios said Wednesday that “No Time to Die,” the release of the next iteration of the James Bond movies, will be postponed until November.\\n\\n• Visa Inc. expects the outbreak to result in fiscal second-quarter revenue that is about 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points lower than the previously issued range of “low double-digit net revenue growth in constant dollars” that Visa gave with its latest earnings report in January. The company said the virus was having a “significant impact” on Asia-related travel that has caused a “sharp slowdown of our cross-border business” for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc. US:WMT anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. “Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,” Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\\n\\n• Walt Disney Co. US:DIS said if its shuttered Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks remain closed for months, it would shave $175 million off operating income in the current quarter. Disney’s movie-studio business could also take a hit, as cinemas are closed in China and Disney is preparing to launch the live-action “Mulan” reboot in March.\\n\\n• Wolverine World Wide Inc. US:WWW provided a downbeat full-year outlook, citing the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its shoe brands, which include Hush Puppies, Sperry, and Stride Rite. The company reported a net loss of $900,000, or 1 cent a share, in the latest quarter, after earnings of $39.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\n• Workday Inc. US:WDAY said it has pulled the plug on an internal sales conference in Orlando, Fla., set for next week that was expected to draw more than 3,000 people. The decision was made because of the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Xenia Hotels & Resorts Inc. US:XHR withdrew the 2020 guidance provided in late February, citing increased uncertainty regarding the financial impact resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. The real-estate investment trust that invests in luxury hotels said group cancellations have increased to $15 million of revenue since Feb. 24, while transient cancellations have increased significantly.\\n\\n• Yum China Holdings Inc. US:YUMC, which operates fast-food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For those that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing “significant interruption,” said Yum China Holdings CEO Joey Wat. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\\n\\n• Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. US:ZBH said the number of elective procedures in China, which makes up about 5% of global revenue, fell by up to 90% in February, and CFO Suketu Upadhyay expects that to continue through March “at a minimum.” There are also now early signs that procedures are slowing down in South Korea.\\n\\n• Zoom Video Communications Inc. US:ZM, which has seen its stock jump as more employers talk about having their workers work from home to prevent the spread of the virus, said all employees at its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., have been told to work from home. “We have definitely seen an uptick in usage, but a lot of that is on the free side,” Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg said during an earnings call.\\n\\nDon’t miss: Here are vulnerable parts of the U.S. economy that coronavirus may infect',\n",

       "   'text': 'In the long-run, does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor?\\n\\nIndeed, even among those investors who don\\'t try to consistently time the markets, many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically. It\\'s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market.\\n\\nGiving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement. For example, many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks to correct, only see the latter achieve new highs, move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels: Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (AACAY), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI), Apple Inc. (AAPL), ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN)\\n\\nFear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react, rather than anticipate market moves.\\n\\nFruitful market timing requires three key parts: 1) A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks (or securities, gold or different kinds of investments). 2) The capacity to act on the sign accurately. 3) The control to follow up on it.\\n\\nMarket timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly. However, there is a less common, rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time.\\n\\nRule 1: Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose-lose situation.\\n\\nForget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit, regardless of whether your calls are spot-on or way off-base.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRule 2: Don\\'t sell during minor crashes - instead, have the patience to weather the storm, or even better, milk the opportunity to buy low.\\n\\nWarren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard. He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul.\\n\\nThere is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10% market correction. If the companies you own are established and successful, they are likely to return to their pre - crash price before long, making holding on the wisest decision. Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn, essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice, \\'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\\'\\n\\nA Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets\\n\\nIt\\'s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market. But, think about this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Indeed, even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn\\'t justify the efforts - and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it, market timing shouldn\\'t be your exclusive methodology for investing, particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg.\\n\\nActively trading for alpha, outsized, short - term gains through market timing and other high - risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets, but for your longer - term retirement assets, a \"risk -adjusted focused\" investment solution generally makes more sense.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to learn how to \\'super-charge\\' your retirement assets, get our free report:\\n\\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.

There are now 621 confirmed cases of the virus among passengers and crew on the ship.\\n\\nThere are 100 U.S. citizens on the ship or in Japanese hospitals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday that they must now undergo a 14-day quarantine after leaving the Diamond Princess and before they can return to the U.S. “Because of their high-risk exposure, there may be additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess,” the CDC said in a statement.\\n\\nMacau is expected to allow casinos to reopen on Thursday. The government shut down gaming operations at casino operators on Feb. 4 over outbreak concerns, prompting CFRA to downgrade three casino stocks, including Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS, +1.08% , MGM Resorts International MGM, +7.20% , and Wynn Resorts WYNN, +2.01% . However, the Macau government said Monday that it is also considering implementing body-temperature checks at casino entrances, requiring employees and customers to wear masks, and setting apart gaming tables by an unspecified distance.\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC MDT, -0.11% told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc.

There are also earnings previews for select companies. Please check back often. This earnings calendar is updated weekly.\\n\\n(Editor\\'s Note: Many earnings dates are tentative but may be moved due to coronavirus-related concerns. However, companies featured in \"Earnings Spotlights\" have officially announced their earnings dates.)\\n\\nEarnings Calendar Highlights\\n\\nMONDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE), Baidu (BIDU), Bilibili (BILI), iQIYI (IQ), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), Trivago (TRVG)\\n\\nTUESDAY\\n\\nEarnings Spotlight: Walmart (WMT, $125.94) - Walmart\\'s positioning as one of the premier \"essential\" retailers during the COVID-19 outbreak has earned it 6% year-to-date gains in a year that the broader blue-chip indices are down by double digits. And it should be no surprise that analysts expect a decent report when Walmart announces quarterly earnings ahead of the May 19 bell. Analysts are looking for a 5.2% improvement in revenues to $130.31 billion, which should fuel a 3.5% bump in profits to $1.17 per share. The question for shareholders is: What does WMT have left in the tank? While Wall Street is still broadly bullish on the name - the stock racked up 17 Buy ratings over the past quarter, versus just six Holds - RBC Capital analyst Scot Ciccarelli (Sector Perform, equivalent of Hold) sees \"limited\" upside. While the company has sales momentum and can be a prime recession stock, Ciccarelli says higher labor and cleaning costs, as well as a frothy valuation, could keep a lid on the stock.\\n\\nEarnings Spotlight: Home Depot (HD, $239.33) - Home Depot is another major name reporting in what will be a big week for retailers. Like Walmart, Home Depot has been deemed \"essential,\" and is widely expected to benefit from an uptick in DIY projects as many people are confined to their homes - that\\'s largely why investors have bid shares up nearly 10% year-to-date. Wells Fargo\\'s Zachary Fadem (Overweight, equivalent of Buy) recently raised his price target on shares from $215 to $260, believing the company will top analyst estimates in its Tuesday morning report, and writing that the company deserves its premium valuation. Wall Street analysts are looking for 3.4% year-over-year revenue growth to $27.28 billion, but a marginal decline in profits to $2.26 per share.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOther Noteworthy Reports: Advance Auto Parts (AAP), Netease (NTES), Sina (SINA), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Weibo (WB)\\n\\nWEDNESDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Analog Devices (ADI), Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories (RDY), Expedia Group (EXPE), Huya (HUYA), L Brands (LB), Lowe\\'s (LOW), McKesson (MCK), Shoe Carnival (SCVL), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Target (TGT), VEREIT (VER), ZTO Express (ZTO)\\n\\nTHURSDAY\\n\\nNoteworthy Earnings Reports: Agilent Technologies (A), Apollo Investment (AINV), Best Buy (BBY), BJ\\'s Wholesale Club (BJ), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL), Intuit (INTU), Nvidia (NVDA), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Ross Stores (ROST), SeaDrill (SDRL), Splunk (SPLK), Teekay Corp. (TK), TJX Cos. (TJX)\\n\\nFRIDAY\\n\\nEarnings Spotlight: Alibaba Group (BABA, $203.68) - The spotlight will shine on China\\'s retail environment at the end of the week, as e-commerce giant Alibaba reports ahead of the May 22 open. BABA shares are only slightly outperforming the Chinese market, at 4% losses versus about 6% for the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI). Nonetheless, it\\'s still a wildly popular pick in the analyst community, where 13 pros have rattled off Buy-equivalent ratings over the past three months, with no opposition. CLSA\\'s Elinor Leung (Buy) notes that Alibaba\\'s recovery isn\\'t even across the board - staples sales have grown, consumer electronics have been resilient, but discretionary products are slow to bounce back. She says Alibaba\\'s quarter ended March \"was a tough quarter.\" On average, analysts expect an 11.9% jump in revenues to $15.20 billion, but a 30.4% drop in earnings to 87 cents per share.\\n\\nOther Noteworthy Reports: Buckle (BKE), Deere (DE), Foot Locker (FL)\\n\\nReporting schedules provided by Briefing.com and company websites.

       "   'title': 'Australias Brambles, Irelands Accenture Are the Most Sustainable Companies Outside the U.S.',\n",
       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nThe most sustainable companies outside the U.S. outperformed a key benchmark for international stocks, mirroring the strength of the companies in Barron’s third annual ranking of the 100 most environmentally and socially responsible businesses in this country.\\n\\nThe 20 companies in the ranking, compiled by Calvert Research & Management, a unit of Eaton Vance (ticker: EV), returned 23.6% for 2019, compared with the 22% return for the MSCI EAFE benchmark, which is much broader and contains 917 companies.\\n\\nTopping the list of non-U.S. companies is Australia’s Brambles (BXB.Australia), which supplies shipping pallets all over the world, and Ireland-based consulting company Accenture (ACN), at No. 2. The two switched places from 2018.\\n\\nBrambles helps customers cut waste and emissions, partly by reusing packaging. Nearly all its wood is sustainably sourced, while 60% of its electricity is from renewables. Brambles shares are “favorably” positioned, Morgan Stanley recently said, because the company has a substantial stock buyback program and limited exposure to Asia, where coronavirus fears are hurting sentiment.\\n\\nAccenture, meanwhile, has “lots of positives from an employee standpoint,” partly because of a strong retraining program that helps transfer workers displaced by artificial intelligence and automation, says Calvert analyst Chris Madden. The company also has done a good job avoiding assignments with clients with poor ethical profiles, says Bruno Bertocci, head of sustainable equities at UBS Asset Management.\\n\\nSustainable Non-US Companies Outperform Source: Calvert Research & Management; Bloomberg\\n\\nThe ranking also contains a number of hospitality companies, such as France’s Accor (AC.France), and Britain’s Whitbread (WTB.UK). “They’ve been reducing their water and energy footprints,” says Calvert’s Madden.\\n\\nAs a group, the companies generally had higher environmental, social, and governance scores, as determined by Calvert, than the U.S. companies. For example, the weighted ESG score for Brambles is 81, while Accenture’s is 80. Seven companies on the list had weighted scores of 77 and 76, matching or beating Agilent (A), the top U.S. company, with a 76.\\n\\n“The scores tend to skew a little higher internationally,” says Madden, partly because of a broader historical recognition in Europe of the needs of stakeholders aside from shareholders. In addition, “regulatory heft in Europe is put behind a lot of environmental and social issues,” he says. Six of the companies are from the U.K., and five from France.\\n\\nDeveloped-market companies outside the U.S. have historically had better disclosure, says UBS’s Bertocci, but the gap between the U.S. and Europe has narrowed so that for the largest companies, “it’s pretty much nonexistent at this point.” Adoption of global disclosure recommendations such as those from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures have helped to diminish the differential.\\n\\nSustainability is directly connected to profitability and thus to stock-price performance. “These issues drive demand for company products, drive operational efficiency within companies, and build productivity across the workforce, all key factors to the competitiveness of a company and its ability to produce a high return on invested capital,” says John Streur, CEO of Calvert.\\n\\nAs a group, the companies are hardly cheap, although their yields are appealing. Collectively, the 20 companies in our ranking have a forward price/earnings ratio of 19.1 times, a P/E to growth rate of 14.1, and a dividend yield of 4.1%. By contrast, the EAFE index has a forward P/E of 15.2 times, a P/E to growth rate of 4.4, and a yield of 3.3%.\\n\\nTo create the Barron’s list of 20 overseas stocks, Calvert started with the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies internationally by market value, ranking them by how they performed for shareholders, employees, customers, community, and the planet. It looked at more than 230 performance indicators that address ESG issues, such as workplace diversity, data security, and greenhouse-gas emissions.\\n\\nBased on the indicators, Calvert assigned a score of zero to 100 in each stakeholder category. Then, it created a weighted average of the categories for each company, based on how financially material each category was for its industry peer group.\\n\\nA more detailed description of the methodology is available at this link.\\n\\nWrite to Leslie P.

Let\\'s check out how the charts have been flowing.\\n\\nIn this daily bar chart of A, below, we can see a May/August double-bottom in price and the subsequent rally to a high last month. Prices pulled back to test the rising 50-day moving average line and trading volume did not expand which a good pattern to observe. Prices are now back above the rising 50-day line and the bullish 200-day line is at a comfortable distance below the price of A. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been going up from its slightly lower low in August. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line but narrowing towards a potential go-long signal.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices broke out on the upside of a long sideways to rising consolidation pattern. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has broken out on the upside of its long sideways pattern and tells us that aggressive buying has been taking place. The MACD oscillator on this longer time frame is bullish, but we could see a crossover to the downside depending on how weak price get in the short-run.\\n\\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of A, below, we used daily price data and here the chart shows that A has reached (and exceeded) a price target.\\n\\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of A, below, we used weekly price data and here a potential price target of $97 is indicated.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: Traders could approach the long side of A at current levels risking a close below $82.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, -3.13% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +0.26% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, -1.05% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +3.64% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

What chart points are now important for this leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets?\\n\\nLet's check.\\n\\nIn this daily bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have rallied 50% from their March low and have made new highs above the January peak. The slopes of the 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving average line are positive and we are about to see the 50-day line cross above the 200-day line for a bullish golden cross signal.\\n\\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has made its own new high to confirm the uptrend and tells us that buyers of A have been more aggressive since the March low. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bullish and pointed upwards.\\n\\nIn this weekly bar chart of A, below, we can see that prices have been in a wide sideways trading range since early 2018. This is a large consolidation pattern and could support a large move higher.\\n\\nThe center point of this pattern could be considered $75 and it would not be unusual for prices to double from this level. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\\n\\nThe weekly OBV line looks like it will make a new all-time high soon and the MACD oscillator crossed above the zero line last month for an outright buy signal.\\n\\nIn this daily Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a price projection of $99.\\n\\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of A, below, we can see a potential price projection of $123.\\n\\nBottom line strategy: The list of stocks that are making new all-time highs is growing and A is now on that list. Traders could go long A on a dip into the $90-$88 area risking a close below $84. $99 and then $123 area our price targets.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

And they upped a stake of Restaurant Brands International QSR, -1.29% QSR, -1.29% , owner of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s, by more than 50%. Pershing Square said as budget-conscious consumers trade down due to the pandemic, they’ll head to cheaper eateries like those.\\n\\nPershing is sticking to fast-food chain Chipotle CMG, -0.77% for its “fortress balance sheet” and zero debt. Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s LOW, -3.13% also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton HLT, +0.26% got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks SBUX, -1.05% , where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes HHC, +3.64% , which will face some tough times due to the crisis.

       "   'text': 'Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said that his Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has exited investments in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK).\\n\\nPershing Square’s stock holding in Berkshire was valued at about $1 billion as of the end of March. Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing.

The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co.

Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic.

US:A topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. US:BBBY plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s US:CLF AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. US:ELF beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. US:ROST reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. US:UA US:UAA upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on reps just to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured accounting of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testings.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

For the three and six months ended April 30, 2020, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15.5%. For the three months ended April 30, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.48%. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.75%. We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, NASD site costs, special compliance costs and tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer. Asset impairments include assets that have been written down to their fair value. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers including costs to move manufacturing due to new tariffs and tariff remediation actions, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system, human resources and financial systems. Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as data privacy regulations, revenue recognition, lease accounting and certain tax reporting requirements. Other includes certain legal costs and settlements and unrealized gains related to our equity securities in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments. Tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer relates to our operations in Singapore along with our application of the new accounting rules for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of assets as adopted on November 1, 2018. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results \"through the eyes\" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information. Page 4\\n\\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business.

       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nBuilding up positions is getting expensive for activist investors.\\n\\nThis year has been more nuanced than previous years, with the pandemic slowing campaigns. Many assumed that investors would quietly increase stakes for long-term plays or agitate for change when the crisis passed.\\n\\nBut while the broader market still trades below February highs, many sectors aren’t exactly cheap. The S&P 500 index currently trades at roughly 22 times expected earnings, by Goldman Sachs’ measure, compared with a historical average in the high teens.\\n\\nConsider Pershing Square’s (ticker: PSHZF) Bill Ackman, who initiated stakes in Blackstone Group (BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) in the first quarter. Ackman is typically a long-term investor, but he quickly sold those positions this quarter. A rally in both stocks made it tough to buy more to make either one a “meaningful-enough investment,” he said on a Wednesday call with investors.\\n\\nInstead, Ackman deployed capital to most of his existing positions, such as Agilent Technologies (A) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT). He also refilled on Starbucks (SBUX). After exiting the chain earlier this year with a 73% gain, Ackman was a buyer last quarter, paying the same multiple that he did in late 2018.\\n\\nSome traditional equities activists veered from their usual playbook to buy credit-default swaps, according to a review from PivotalPath. Ackman successfully employed that strategy earlier this year.\\n\\nThere are opportunities for activists, but they might involve going beyond familiar ground.\\n\\nWrite to Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",

And they upped a stake of Restaurant Brands International US:QSR US:QSR, owner of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s, by more than 50%. Pershing Square said as budget-conscious consumers trade down due to the pandemic, they’ll head to cheaper eateries like those.\\n\\nPershing is sticking to fast-food chain Chipotle US:CMG for its “fortress balance sheet” and zero debt. Their stake in home-improvement retailer Lowe’s US:LOW also rose by just over 50% and Pershing likes that as a longer-term beneficiary from the pandemic. Hilton US:HLT got some high praise, though investors will need to be patient, for its “resilient business model,” and the fact the company is working hard on technology, such as keyless rooms to bring back its clients.\\n\\nThen there is Starbucks US:SBUX, where Pershing completely rebuilt a stake. The coffee giant has seen a huge COVID-19 hit, but will “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” Pershing also bought more real-estate development company Howard Hughes US:HHC, which will face some tough times due to the crisis. On the upside, people still value homeownership now, said Ackman.\\n\\nThe chart\\n\\nThis Goldman Sachs chart shows the recovering, but bumpy trajectory for China consumer activity — includes hotels, movie, theater, retail sales, airline seat miles — post pandemic, versus the U.S., where it is obviously deeply depressed.

Ackman divested the Blackstone position as shares have soared about 57% over the past two months, erasing all of their losses from earlier this year.\\n\\nDespite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 27% on its investments as of May 26.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad\\n\\nSpeaking on an investor conference call, Ackman said that Pershing Square has about 85% to 98% of its assets invested in its funds and is holding cash positions of between 15% and 20%.\\n\\n“We think it\\'s a very different environment than when we made the investment in Berkshire a year ago”, said partner Ryan Israel, who oversaw Pershing’s Berkshire investment, on the investor call. “We continue to think Berkshire will be a strong investment over the longer term, but we also think the current environment means there may be more than typical opportunities for us to see very high-returning investments and we wanted to make sure we have enough cash.”\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection.\\n\\nAckman said that today, “we have $10 billion of capital to invest; we can be much more nimble,\" adding that he wants to “take advantage of that nimbleness, preserve some extra liquidity in the event that prices get more attractive again.\"\\n\\nThe billionaire investor informed investors that Pershing increased its positions in Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) by 16% at an average price of $64.57, while the stock is now trading at $86.18 a share. He also ramped up the portfolio’s stakes in Lowes Companies (LOW) at $84 a share (now trades at $128 a share), Howard Hughes, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as rebuilt the Starbucks position at $60 a share. Shares in the coffee chain are currently trading at $78.60.\\n\\n“So far so good,” Ackman said. “Everything we currently own is undervalued.”\\n\\nSome analysts view Blackstone as a worthwhile investment. CFRA recently upgraded Blackstone to Buy from Hold, citing the company’s attractive valuation. “We view positively the secular growth opportunities at Blackstone, evidenced by 2019 asset inflows that topped $134 billion” CFRA said.\\n\\n“Though near-term results could be uneven amid market uncertainty and volatility, demand for private-equity investments will be fueled by the persistently low interest-rate environment” the firm explained, adding that Blackstone is also poised to deploy its more than $150 billion of unallocated capital in a marketplace where asset values have become more attractive.\\n\\nShares in Blackstone rose less than 1% to $56.46 as of Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nTurning now to the Street’s outlook on Blackstone stock, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are still cautiously optimistic. The Moderate Buy consensus consists of 8 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. However, in view of the recent share rally, the $53.85 average price target now implies 4.6% downside potential over the coming year.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 edged closer to 100,000 on Saturday, as the news emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been combining the results of two different types of tests for the illness in a move that has been sharply criticized by health experts.\\n\\nThe CDC has been combining diagnostic test results, which show whether a patient currently has the virus, with antibody test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus, the Atlantic magazine reported. The CDC confirmed the report to MarketWatch.\\n\\n“This is not merely a technical error,” the Atlantic wrote. “States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points.”\\n\\nThe story cited Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as saying the two tests provide totally different signals. By combining them, the agency has made both sets of results “uninterpretable.”\\n\\n“How could the CDC make that mistake?” he asked. “This is a mess.”\\n\\nFor more, see: CDC faces more coronavirus testing questions, this time about how many diagnostic tests are being conducted\\n\\nThe news comes as all 50 states start to reopen for business following lockdowns and other restrictions on movement, with most following CDC guidelines that are based on carefully monitoring data points based on testing. Americans are expected to move more freely over the coming long Memorial Day holiday weekend that signals the start of summer.\\n\\nRead now: States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: More beaches, casinos open ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend\\n\\nIt also comes as an ABC News/Ispos poll found that just 39% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis, the lowest reading for the president since the poll started to track sentiment in March.\\n\\nA Fox News poll published on Thursday found just 44% of those polled approve of Trump’s performance, down from 49% in April. The same poll found 74% approved of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the pandemic, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and 70% approved of the actions of state governments. A full 88% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSee also: The U.S. is in ‘relative decline’ as ‘Chinese power is rapidly rising,’ warns Ray Dalio\\n\\nTrump was busy on Twitter Friday, lashing out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after she called him a “petulant child” for refusing to wear a face mask at all times, while touring a Ford Motor Co. F, +6.13% plant that has switched production to make ventilators and masks. Trump spoke to reporters without a mask, while saying and being photographed wearing one for part of the tour.\\n\\nAn observational study published Friday in medical journal The Lancet examining 96,032 COVID-19 patients in 671 hospitals across six continents concluded that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine had no benefit on outcomes while those patients were in the hospital.\\n\\nThe therapies are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients taking them while in the hospital.\\n\\n“These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe two drugs have been approved by the FDA for use in treating malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were granted emergency authorization during the pandemic. They have been regularly touted by President Donald Trump, who said this week that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine.

A.B. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, echoing the concerns of other analysts on the conference call, expressed wariness over what he called another “significant multi-year effort” by HPE to slash costs.

A, +0.71% topped earnings and revenue expectations in its latest quarter. Chief Executive Mike McMullen said the company is well-positioned to “face the challenges” of the pandemic and was poised to focus on “growth, a resilient business model, and strong balance sheet.”\\n\\n• Alibaba has seen a “steady recovery since March” after the COVID-19 outbreak dampened its business earlier in the year. The company’s profit and revenue topped analyst estimates. The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December. For the full fiscal year, which ended in March, Alibaba saw RMB7.1 trillion ($995 trillion) in gross merchandise volume across its “digital economy.” For the new fiscal year, the company expects over RMB650 billion in revenue, while analysts were modeling RMB659 billion.\\n\\n• Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +8.04% plans to reopen 600 stores, including 500 across North America, and bring back about 11,000 furloughed workers by June 13. In addition to 500 Bed Bath & Beyond locations in the U.S. and Canada, about 50 Christmas Tree Shops and 50 Cost Plus World Market stores will begin operating. As of February 2020, the company had 1,500 stores, and 55,000 workers, according to FactSet. Bed Bath & Beyond is expanding contactless curbside pickup services to 1,350 stores total, adding 600. Traffic to the Bed Bath & Beyond website and mobile app is up more than 30% over recent weeks and digital sales have doubled, according to a statement from CEO Mark Tritton. The retailer’s safety plan includes enhanced sanitation, protective gear for workers and limiting the number of people allowed in stores at one time.\\n\\n• Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; s CLF, +2.24% AK Steel subsidiary is increasing spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $40 per ton, effective immediately. That suggests prices are rising by at least 4%, as the iron ore mining company said the average net selling price per net ton of flat-rolled steel during the first quarter was $997.\\n\\n• Deere reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that fell amid business disruptions related to the pandemic, but beat expectations. Agriculture and turf revenue declined 18% to $5.97 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, while construction and forestry revenue fell 25% to $2.26 billion but beat expectations of $2.10 billion. The company expects full-year net income of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.04 billion.\\n\\n• E.L.F. Beauty Inc. ELF, +2.08% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to “increased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019” due to the pandemic. The company has seen “significant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,” with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.” E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\\n\\n• Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--”to preserve financial flexibility.”. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion. The company said the phased reopening of its stores is underway.\\n\\nSee:Do you want to work from home post-pandemic? Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding\\n\\n• Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -1.17% reported a surprise first-quarter loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations. Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. “We have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,” Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. UA, +1.19% UAA, +1.06% upsized and priced a $440 million offering of senior convertible notes that mature in 2024. The athletic apparel maker originally planned to raise $400 million in the deal. The notes are being sold in a private offering and priced at an interest rate of 1.5% a year. The notes can be settled in shares of class C common stock, cash or a combination of the two, at Under Armour’s discretion. Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of capped call transaction that will minimize the dilutive impact of conversion, and to repay debt.\\n\\nCybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic, and it could cost you\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Jaimy Lee',\n",

(Operator Instructions) And now I would like to introduce you to the host for today\\'s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Jody, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\\'s conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nOn the webcast today are Mike McMullen, Agilent\\'s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent\\'s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining for the Q&A after prepared remarks will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\\'s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; and Sam Raha, President of Agilent\\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; along with Padraig McDonnell, President of Agilent CrossLab Group.

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.\\n\\nI\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I\\'m glad he could be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in 4 key areas.\\n\\nLet me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We\\'re doubling-down on reps just to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured accounting of order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume.\\n\\nThe near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testings.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.\\n\\nThe food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.\\n\\nLooking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.\\n\\nAs a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.\\n\\nAs we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\\'re up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\\'re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.\\n\\nThe pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2.\\n\\nIn total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note while we have seen some order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.\\n\\nOur resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots, with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.\\n\\nThe pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.\\n\\nWhile we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume.\\n\\nWe generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio, as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend.\\n\\nAs you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter.\\n\\nWhen we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.\\n\\nNow on the higher end of the decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there\\'s still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we\\'re using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we\\'re looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy.\\n\\nOverall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the first 2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A. Mike?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there, too?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take that, Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again, this isn\\'t guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there\\'s obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil prices, how much of a factor that is?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. Bob, I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So we\\'re seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we\\'re assuming kind of the current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first 2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.\\n\\nAnd Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there\\'s an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2 follow-ups.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry.\\n\\nI would also tell you that valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you\\'re looking at, and does it make sense for the company.\\n\\nAnything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick one. I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you\\'re right, what we have seen is the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we\\'re starting to see some of the U.S. It\\'s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on -- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue, especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers.\\n\\nThe last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment, and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It\\'s certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could actually be a positive if it\\'s oversupply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you\\'re seeing there and the expectations going forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what\\'s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\\'ve got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this, understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snap back quickly?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to predict, the timing of transition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes, yes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we\\'re continuing to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there\\'s a push at looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. -- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\\'re actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, while Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there.\\n\\nRelative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor it. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Pretty good math.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou have pretty good math, Dan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So we actually...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBecause of the word \"plateau\" earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework, I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late May.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off base.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think, Bob, it\\'s maybe just worth mentioning that although we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end markets and geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just leave it at that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word \"uncertainty\" because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opening up in the U.S., we\\'re getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDoug Schenkel, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time, while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche\\'s and for the technology testing. So with that, there\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into COVID.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because there\\'s a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So no stocking effect.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics. Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business, where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together, and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So I\\'m trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those lines? And I wasn\\'t sure if this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with instrumentation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7% because I\\'m trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe just help us understand the range that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay, it wouldn\\'t. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Understood. No, that\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand in the latter part of this year. But that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter, especially around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That\\'s about 70% of our pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments, but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They\\'re all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big drags for you guys.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3 business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China, and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given COVID...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It\\'s really driven by the biopharma business, but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now, COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Gregory Brennan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Life Sciences [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient\\'s willingness to go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that\\'s -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we\\'re quite pleased we posted 5% core growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this quarter, but it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that, that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you. And that\\'s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.',\n",

Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\\n\\nAnd now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Ankur and thanks, everyone for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I\\'m pleased to have Padraig McDonnel, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading ACG. I know you will enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role and I\\'m glad he can be here with us on the call.\\n\\nLast quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February, but what hasn\\'t changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.\\n\\nIt should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handler systems for their COVID-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we\\'re doubling down on efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.\\n\\nOur third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn\\'t shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. We quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.\\n\\nBob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.\\n\\nBefore covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth.\\n\\nOur Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we\\'ve made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program.\\n\\nGiven changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we\\'ve made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\\'ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\\'s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.\\n\\nOur China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the US, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSome quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\\'s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, Pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in Diagnostics and Clinical. The Food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our Environmental and Forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2, Academia and Chemical and Energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life sciences industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19.\\n\\nBefore closing, I\\'d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.\\n\\nTo address this, we have mobilized a cross Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob you\\'re up.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3.\\n\\nGiven the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nReported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the US and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.\\n\\nBefore getting into some additional group details, it\\'s also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellation, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instruments business declined.\\n\\nLSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research In addition, as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high-single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m pleased to say that our DGG business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the US and Europe. We saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions, except the US, where the effect of delayed in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific, flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned China grew 4%.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.\\n\\nAs a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross Margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.\\n\\nNow, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we\\'ve taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.\\n\\nIn addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won\\'t be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.\\n\\nHowever, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar to April and the business activity we\\'ve seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.\\n\\nA combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2. Now on the higher end of this decline, we\\'re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the US and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the US and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.\\n\\nIn Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.\\n\\nBefore I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\\'s performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\\'d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\\'ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.\\n\\nAnd with that, I believe Mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\\'t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I\\'m absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur, so we can take your questions. Thank you.\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra -- Vice President of Investor Relations\\n\\nJodi, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Thanks. I\\'m going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDo you want to take that Bob?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I\\'ll take the question. I\\'ll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It\\'s mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress there. So that is, it has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.\\n\\nOn the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. It\\'s kind of a range of scenarios that we\\'re planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So we\\'re -- it\\'s a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in C&E and given the volatility in oil prices. How much of a factor that is?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. Yeah, Bob. I\\'ll take that one. So I think for C&E, for Q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we\\'re starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we\\'re seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we\\'re assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah, Tycho. If you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. It didn\\'t have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And one clarification [Speech Overlap]\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it\\'s important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You\\'re kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we\\'re thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. And Bob, I\\'ll let you comment on the financial side of that.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. It is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in Q2.\\n\\nTycho Peterson -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we\\'ve seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we\\'d like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company and we\\'ve talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we\\'ve acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I would also tell you the valuations haven\\'t moved much. So this is not a buyer\\'s market, and you can buy things on the cheap. So you really have to be think through what you\\'re looking at, and it doesn\\'t make sense for the company. Anything else to add to that Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or --\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Sorry, I thought, Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of April snap back. You commented on a specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I\\'m curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. I\\'ll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you\\'re right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has -- I wouldn\\'t call it a snapback, but it\\'s a recovery. And we\\'re actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it\\'s actually coming back faster. And then the US, and now we\\'re starting to see some of the US, it\\'s still very early days in the US, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I\\'ll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\\'s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\\n\\nPadraig McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Agilent CrossLab Group\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yeah, very, very strong demand. We\\'re seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. And especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we\\'ve developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd Steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously ACG grew 1%. It would have been stronger several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn\\'t install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we\\'ll come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\\n\\nSteve Beuchaw -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Mike maybe one for you on the C&E segment. Certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there obviously E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, I know typically low oil supply. It feels like at least part of what\\'s going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. That\\'s a great question. And what we often trying to think that what\\'s really -- we\\'re really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\\'m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\\'ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\\'s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIn my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\\'s really just tied to events that I\\'m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\\'s supply chain. And we\\'re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.\\n\\nSo we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\\'t get too excited. This -- I would just say, let\\'s assume that it\\'s going to stay subdued for a while, as we\\'re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, absolutely.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\\'s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\\'s kind of addressing?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\\'t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs under way that aren\\'t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\\n\\nPatrick Donnelly -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Mike.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou are quite welcome.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Derik.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nHello. Good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\\'s that -- where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\\'m just curious on the base.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\\'s tracking well to that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\\'ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\\'ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\\'re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd there\\'s some real talent in that team, and there\\'s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\\'re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nSo you mentioned that you\\'re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\\'s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\\'re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\\'s happening now between the US and China in terms of your China business?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll -- hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\\'ll take the first one, and I\\'ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\\'re actually watching that very closely. It\\'s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\\'s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the US providing a contract here in the US for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we\\'re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\\'s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is, we\\'re actively scenario planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\\'t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd if I can squeeze one more in.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nWhile Agilent doesn\\'t do -- you don\\'t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\\'m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\\'s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\\'m just curious in terms of what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. A couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don\\'t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\\'ve -- I\\'ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\\'ve got a good feel for the demand that we\\'re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\\'re not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.\\n\\nJust a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\\'re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\\'re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\\'s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\\'re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.\\n\\nRelative -- it\\'s funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\\'re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\\'re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\\'ve not yet seen that.\\n\\nDerik de Bruin -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\\'ve seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. You\\'re in the ballpark.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou\\'re pretty at good math, Dan.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\\'t trust the trend in China and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\\'t come through that way in my remarks. So actually...\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. There\\'s the plateau earlier. I wasn\\'t sure.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\\'s wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don\\'t think we\\'re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\\'s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\\n\\nDan Leonard -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you for that clarification. [Indecipherable]\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Doug. How are you doing?\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nI\\'m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\\'s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\\'m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\\'m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\\'re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I think Bob, it\\'s -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\\'t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nThat\\'s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\\'m just wondering, recognizing it\\'s an unusual time, if you\\'d be willing to go to that level just because it\\'s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\\'d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\\'ll just leave it at that.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd it\\'s tied directly to the opening a facility.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\\'s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\\'s really -- that\\'s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\\'t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\\'ve gotten the business. We know as they\\'ve been opening up in Europe, we\\'re getting the business. And then when they\\'ve slowly been opened up in the US, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\\'t opening up right now, unless you\\'re doing COVID-19 research.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\\'s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\\'d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\\'s going on there.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [Indecipherable] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\\'s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\\'ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Jacob.\\n\\nDoug Schenkel -- Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay, great. Thanks, again.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi, Puneet. How are you doing?\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSam, I think the answer is no, but I\\'m going to -- you haven\\'t had a chance to talk today. So why don\\'t you confirm or deny this room or around.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\\'s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\\'s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\\'ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nHey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\\'s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\\'t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll make some initial comments, and I\\'ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\\'re overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\\'s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\\'re doing that doesn\\'t require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\\n\\nSam Raha -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group\\n\\nYeah. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\\'s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\\'t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\\'t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can -- if there\\'s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\\'t sure, this is in Sam\\'s bucket or it\\'s actually in the LSAG bucket.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\\'ll tell you it\\'s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\\n\\nPuneet Souda -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s great. All right, thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks guys for squeezing me in here.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Vijay. No problem.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nMike, so I think, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\\'m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t -- Vijay, you wouldn\\'t, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? So what we\\'re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\\'t get any better in the US and Europe and we didn\\'t really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\\'re saying we don\\'t expect that. We hope that that\\'s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in US and Europe. But if you do the math that you\\'re saying, you don\\'t get there, you get a lot better. You get toward the minus 5%.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nUnderstood. That\\'s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We haven\\'t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\\'s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\\n\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thanks guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, significant disruption, but it\\'s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\\'s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. And then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I would say, I mean, we\\'ve been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, Bob. I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\\'re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\\'t take shortcuts here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\\'ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\\n\\nBrandon Couillard -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nOkay. Thank you.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question guys.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Dan.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nI was hoping maybe to -- hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\\'re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\\'ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\\'ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major...\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\\'s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\\'ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\\'ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nJacob Thaysen -- Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group\\n\\nWell, I can add to that. The consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nGot it. And I know there was already a question I think -- thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you\\'re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\\n\\nMike McMullen -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the US business in pathology. So that\\'s one of the areas of \"uncertainty\" we\\'re looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\\'ve not yet seen it in the pathology US business and that puts somewhat of a -- that\\'s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the US, which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon -- Senior Vice President, Agilent Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. And Dan, that\\'s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\\'s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\\'t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\\'re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\\'s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\\'s one of the things that is still in front of us.\\n\\nDan Brennan -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nRobert W.

For the three and six months ended April 30, 2020, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15.5%. For the three months ended April 30, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.48%. For the six months ended April 30, 2019, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.75%. We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, NASD site costs, special compliance costs and tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer. Asset impairments include assets that have been written down to their fair value. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers including costs to move manufacturing due to new tariffs and tariff remediation actions, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system, human resources and financial systems. Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as data privacy regulations, revenue recognition, lease accounting and certain tax reporting requirements. Other includes certain legal costs and settlements and unrealized gains related to our equity securities in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments. Tax benefit on intra-entity asset transfer relates to our operations in Singapore along with our application of the new accounting rules for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of assets as adopted on November 1, 2018. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results \"through the eyes\" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information. Page 4\\n\\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

This indicates a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying a decline of 4.97% from the year-ago reported figure.\\n\\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\\n\\nFactors to Note\\n\\nThe company’s fiscal second-quarter sales might have been affected by the global coronavirus-led economic crisis. It faced disruptions in manufacturing operations, which may have further impacted top-line growth.\\n\\nLast month, the company stated that although its fiscal second-quarter revenues grew 2% (up 1% on a core basis) through March, it witnessed significant disruptions in business activities in late March, particularly in the United States and Europe. Customers have either closed or restricted access to Agilent’s facilities in a bid to slow the virus spread.\\n\\nThe company is taking all the necessary steps to reduce expenses and protect the safety, health, and well being of employees and customers.\\n\\nIts expanding product portfolio should have been a key growth driver. The acquisition of BioTek Instruments should have served as a tailwind for Agilent in the quarter.\\n\\nThe deal is expected to have expanded the Cell Analysis business and aided top-line growth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn addition, the companys Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth in pharma, as well as strength in genomics.\\n\\nAgilent expanded its share in next-gen sequencing, which is expected to have driven the top line in the pathology business. Also, growth of the API business should have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative product launches is expected to have aided its performance.\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Agilent this time around.

       "   'title': 'Can Amazon Solve the Covid-19 Testing Challenge?',\n",
       "   'text': 'Text size\\n\\nAmazon. com has successfully invaded many different businesses—but Covid-19 testing? The company said during its recent earnings call that it expects to spend $4 billion or more in the second quarter responding to the pandemic. Among other things, it is spending “hundreds of millions to develop our own Covid-19 testing capabilities.”\\n\\nThis news has Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wondering if Amazon might evolve into a major Covid-19 testing player. “We believe the goal is to create Covid-19 testing stations that Amazon employees can pass through on a daily basis,” Nowak writes in a note. “Amazon expects to spend $1 billion on this initiative between April and the end of 2020.”\\n\\nNowak believes Amazon will work on a rapid saliva test. He’s upbeat, despite many unmet promises around testing and Amazon’s lack of experience. He ticks off three challenges, which, he says, play to its strengths. One is supply chain. “The tests will need to be produced in massive quantities and manufacturing capacity built quickly,” he writes. The second is optimization of a test likely to struggle with efficiency and accuracy. The third is capital; Amazon is flush.\\n\\nWhy would Amazon want to get into testing? Nowak, who has an Overweight rating and a $2,600 target price for the stock, argues that employee and customer safety could become a competitive edge in e-commerce. “The potential public goodwill created through [sharing] this cannot be valued, and in a world where tech regulation is a recurring topic, could be a game changer,” he writes.\\n\\nAmazon itself is playing things down. “We’re not sure how far we will get in the relevant time frame, but we think it’s worth trying,” Amazon said.\\n\\nThis Week\\n\\nMonday 5/18\\n\\nThe World Health Organization holds its 73rd World Health Assembly.

Consensus estimates are for a 34.5 reading, up from April’s 30 figure.

       "   'text': 'The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose above 71,000 on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump appeared to back off his announcement that he would phase out the government task force created to manage the pandemic.\\n\\nTrump said on a visit to Arizona on Tuesday that he would be winding down the task force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence and includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, another public-health expert who is White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted that the force would continue its work indefinitely, although it may add or subtract members over time as it refocuses on reopening the economy, along with vaccines and therapeutics.\\n\\nTrump has been pushing to reopen an economy that all but closed down amid stay-at-home orders from governors seeking to contain the spread and avoid overwhelming hospitals and health-care workers. The president has tweeted support for protesters in states including Michigan against restrictions on movement.\\n\\nDemocrats had criticized the plan to wind down the task force, given the U.S. is still seeing increases in case numbers and deaths. Trump acknowledged that reopening would possibly result in more deaths but said, “we can’t sit in the house for the next three years.”\\n\\nA group of young volunteers recruited by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner that was tasked with securing personal protective equipment, or PPE, for frontline workers were told to prioritize tips from political allies and associates of the president, the New York Times reported.\\n\\nCiting emails and documents obtained by their reporters, the paper said few of the leads actually panned out and the volunteers, who had no experience in procurement, were confused and overwhelmed by the task. PPE has been in short supply across the U.S. since the start of the outbreak and is reported to have contributed to infections among health-care and other medical workers.\\n\\nRead: Your genes could determine whether coronavirus puts you in the hospital — and we’re starting to unravel which ones matter\\n\\nIn the U.K., a scientist and top government adviser on the pandemic resigned after he was caught breaking lockdown rules. Prof. Neil Ferguson quit the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment,” as the Guardian reported. The move came after a Daily Telegraph report revealed that Ferguson’s lover had crossed London to visit him at least twice after lockdown measures were implemented.\\n\\nLatest tallies\\n\\nThe U.K.’s case tally crossed 200,000 on Wednesday and it now has the highest death toll in Europe, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K. has 202,355 cases and 30,150 deaths, putting its death toll ahead of Italy’s, which was an early hot spot. Official numbers from the U.K. have a slightly different tally.\\n\\nThere are 3.71 million cases of COVID-19 globally and 259,695 people have died. At least 1.2 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case toll at 1.21 million and the highest death toll at 71,463.\\n\\nSpain has the highest number of cases in Europe at 219,329 and 25,613 deaths. Italy has 214,457 cases and 29,684 deaths.\\n\\nFrance has 170,694 cases and 25,538 deaths. Germany has 167,372 cases and 6,993 deaths.\\n\\nRussia has 165,929 cases and 1,537 deaths after another big spike in infections overnight. Turkey has 131,744 cases and 3,584 deaths, followed by Brazil with 116,299 cases and 7,966 deaths. Iran has 101,650 cases and 6,418 deaths. China, where the disease was first reported late last year, has 83,968 cases and 4,637 deaths.\\n\\nWhat’s the latest medical news?\\n\\nAdaptive Biotechnologies Corp. US:ADPT has launched a virtual clinical study with Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT aimed at better understanding the immune response in 1,000 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus.\\n\\nThe study will use diagnostic tests made by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings US:LH, who will send employees to the participants’ homes to collect the samples, which will then be used to examine patients’ T-cells. Adaptive previously announced plans to work on an antibody program with Amgen US:AMGN that aims to develop a therapy that can prevent or treat COVID-19.\\n\\nSee now:These 21 companies are working on coronavirus treatments or vaccines — here’s where things stand\\n\\nRelated:The FDA tightens rules around antibody tests as companies talk up their value\\n\\nWhat’s the economy saying?\\n\\nPrivate-sector companies shed a whopping 20.2 million jobs in April as many were forced to shutter during a nationwide shutdown to slow the coronavirus, underscoring the biggest crisis for American workers and the U.S. labor market in nearly a century.\\n\\nSmall employers, defined as having one to 49 workers, shed 6 million jobs in April, according to data from Automatic Data Processing Inc., as MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. Mid-size companies, defined as having 50 to 499 workers, shed 5.3 million jobs, large businesses with 500 employees or more axed 8.9 million jobs.\\n\\nHealth-care jobs were not immune as the pandemic causes a steep decline in treatments for non-virus conditions and the postponement of elective procedures, the data show. Health-care companies cut almost a million jobs. The news has bolstered expectations that Friday’s April jobs report will be grim.\\n\\nRead: Millions of layoffs set to push unemployment rate to highest level since Great Depression\\n\\nSee now:U.S. jobless claims climb 3.8 million in late April to push coronavirus total to 30 million\\n\\nWhat are companies saying?\\n\\nIn earnings news, Walt Disney Co. US:DIS said profit fell more than 90% in its fiscal second quarter, as parks were ordered to close, film production stalled and TV advertising was disrupted. Disney has faced some of the biggest fears from Wall Street about its business during the coronavirus crisis, as its largest units are centered around on-premise interactions that have been shut down during shelter-in-place orders: Theme parks and cruise lines, movies and live sports, for example.\\n\\nAnalysts said the company’s release prompted more questions than answers and criticized the lack of detail on what lies ahead on the earnings call.\\n\\n“Of course we did not expect Disney to opine on timing of openings for Parks, theaters, sports, or content production,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote. “However, we had hoped for better clarity on Parks burn rate when closed, margin profile when opened at reduced capacity, operating rules/implications/parameters for operating in a pre-vaccine world.”\\n\\nFor more, see:Disney earnings leave more questions than answers as COVID-19 pressures theme parks and more\\n\\nThere was better news from videogame makers Activision Blizzard Inc. US:ATVI and Electronic Arts Inc. US:EA, which both reported healthy increases in sales and profit as Americans sheltering in place switched to the virtual world for entertainment.\\n\\nThe companies don’t expect much change: EA predicted profits this quarter would triple from the year before to more than a quarter-billion dollars, while Activision forecast adjusted profit of more than $500 million, a 67% increase.\\n\\nSee also:Videogames are flourishing in the pandemic, and game makers aren’t scared of the future\\n\\nBeyond Meat Inc. US:BYND said disruption in the meat supply chain as facilities with infected worker are forced to close has been a boost to its lineup of meat substitutes and plant-based products. Beyond Meat reported fiscal first-quarter results that blew past Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 7% in extended trading. Shares have surged 85% since March 18, as retailers request “expedited” deliveries to refill shelves across the country, a company spokesperson said.\\n\\nRival Impossible Foods, which is privately held for now, also reported business that was “full steam ahead.”\\n\\nFor more, read:Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat see spike in demand as coronavirus wreaks havoc on meat supply\\n\\nGeneral Motors Co. US:GM delivered another surprise with the car maker beating expectations for profit and revenue despite the steep slowdown in car sales during the pandemic.\\n\\nHere’s the latest things companies are saying about COVID-19:\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. US:A has started to reopen stores that were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic in those locations where regulations allow it. “We are optimistic for the future and we’re happy to announce that we have begun to open select stores globally on a rolling basis and will continue to do so in the weeks ahead,” Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said in a regulatory filing. “We will open stores as State and local regulations allow and as we are able to meet the applicable safety and health standards.”\\n\\n• Bunge Ltd. US:BG reported a surprise first-quarter loss, revenue that fell below expectations and provided a downbeat full-year outlook, saying that while it didn’t experience a significant disruption to its business from the pandemic, it did start to see the negative impact of a change in consumer behavior in its edible oils business in March. “Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,” said Chief Executive Greg Heckman. The company said it expects 2020 EPS to be lower than its original expectation.\\n\\n• CVS Health Corp. US:CVS reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, as its pharmacy and retail business got a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pharmacy businesses benefited from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19-related lockdowns. CVS affirmed its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is above the current FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• General Motors reported first-quarter profit and revenue that fell, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to suspended operations, but beat expectations as U.S. truck sales rose sharply. GM’s U.S. sales fell 7%, driven by the negative effects of the pandemic, but sales of full-size pickups rose 27%, with market share increasing to 41%. Among actions GM has taken to preserve cash during the pandemic include suspension of its dividend and share repurchases, salary cuts and drawing on its credit facilities.\\n\\n• Office Depot Inc. US:ODP posted first-quarter earnings that blew past estimates. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Office Depot had liquidity of $1.7 billion at quarter end, its highest net cash position in two years. “Our B2B focus is helping businesses remain operational in the home or at the office, our facilities have largely remained open serving customers with enhanced sanitation and safety protocols, and our e-commerce platform and retail stores are proving to be trusted means for customers to access the critical products and services they need,” Chief Executive Gerry Smith said in a statement. Same-store sales rose 2% in the quarter and e-commerce sales saw a strong jump in demand, he said. The company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance given the uncertainty around the pandemic and is suspending temporarily its share buybacks and dividend payments. Separately, it announced that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, to block any party from taking advantage of a falling share price to build a stake in the company.\\n\\n• Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. US:SPR swung to a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter on revenue that fell less than forecast. The suspension of Boeing Co’s US:BA production of the 737 MAX plane led to lower margins as given “abnormal” costs associated with the pandemic. Actions the company has taken to preserve liquidity and cut costs amid the 737 MAX groundings and the COVID-19 pandemic include cutting the dividend, suspending share buybacks, deferring repayments of an advance from Boeing and cutting jobs and work schedules. The company will not provide 2020 financial guidance given the continued uncertainties surrounding the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic.\\n\\n• United Airlines Inc. US:UAL is offering $2.25 billion in senior secured notes in a private offering. The bonds will be offered in two tranches maturing in 2023 and 2025. Proceeds of the deal will be used to repay a $2.0 billion term loan entered into in March and for general corporate purposes. Airlines have been tapping credit lines and government relief plans with most fleets grounded during the pandemic.\\n\\n• Wendy’s Co. US:WEN reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. Wendy’s had a cash balance of $365 million as of May 3 after fully drawing down its revolving financing facility, reducing its second-quarter dividend and taking other measures due to the pandemic. Nearly all (96%) of Wendy’s restaurants are operating, including 99% in the U.S., with drive-through and delivery only. Wendy’s has said that disruptions to the beef supply chain has put limits on the availability of certain menu items.',\n",

       "   'title': \"Agilent Technologies, Inc. -- Moody's assigns P-2 rating to Agilent's new commercial paper program, affirms Baa2 rating, outlook stable\",\n",
       "   'text': 'NOTE: On May 05, 2020, the press release was corrected as follows: In the debt list, for Agilent Technologies, Inc., under “Outlook action” was changed to “Maintained, Stable.” Revised release follows.\\n\\nNew York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody\\'s Investors Service, (\"Moody\\'s) assigned a P-2 short term rating to Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\'s (\"Agilent\") new $1.0 billion commercial paper program. Concurrently, Moody\\'s affirmed the Baa2 senior unsecured rating. The outlook is stable.\\n\\nThe new $1.0 billion program is supported by Agilent\\'s $1.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring March 2024. Moody\\'s anticipates that Agilent will not issue more under its CP program than is available under its revolving credit facility at any given time, to maintain full back-stop under the program. The credit agreement has no material adverse change clause or material adverse event language related to litigation that would restrict borrowings. The revolver has same-day availability for US borrowings.\\n\\nThe P-2 rating reflects Agilent\\'s excellent liquidity, the company had $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash at January 31, 2020, offset by approximately $675 million of short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt. Agilent has full availability under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The revolver contains financial maintenance covenants. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is currently set at 3.5x, and Moody\\'s expects the company will maintain ample cushion under the leverage covenant.\\n\\nThe rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, the deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented. The life science tools and services sector has been one of the sectors adversely affected by the shock.\\n\\nMore specifically, Agilent will be impacted by the temporary closure of some research labs, deferral of customers\\' spending on expensive capital equipment and reduced demand from certain economically sensitive industrial and applied end-markets. Further, reduced physician visits and the deferral of healthcare services will also negatively impact demand for certain clinical diagnostics products. Moody\\'s regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, the affirmation of the Baa2 rating reflects Moody\\'s views that Agilent is well positioned at the current Baa2 rating. This reflects the company\\'s strong market positions, diversification both in terms of geographies and end-markets, and conservative financial policies -- as evidenced by leverage that is modest for the Baa2 rating. Further, Agilent has taken steps to adjust its cost base and manage cash conservatively, which includes the suspension of its share buyback program.\\n\\nMoody\\'s took the following rating actions for Agilent Technologies Inc.:\\n\\nAssignments:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\n....Commercial Paper, Assigned P-2\\n\\nRatings affirmed:\\n\\n..Issuer: Agilent Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nSenior unsecured, at Baa2\\n\\nOutlook action:\\n\\nMaintained, Stable\\n\\nRATINGS RATIONALE\\n\\nThe Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating reflects Agilent\\'s favorable scale, strong competitive positions, attractive growth prospects across key markets, good customer and geographic diversification, moderate leverage, and excellent liquidity. Agilent\\'s ratings also reflect Moody\\'s expectations that the company will maintain conservative financial policies with debt/EBITDA approaching 2.0x in the next 12-18 months. The company\\'s rating is constrained by a relatively high reliance on revenue generated from the sale of expensive equipment used in analytical laboratories. This increases Agilent\\'s sensitivity to economic cycles.\\n\\nReflecting the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the lost business days by the customers of life science companies such as Agilent will temporarily reduce the demand for certain consumable products. Further, some equipment purchases will be delayed. The company\\'s operations, products and services are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for handling, storing and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. An inability to adhere to such standards could result in financial penalties and remediation costs. However, the company applies strict standards for the protection of the environment and occupational health, and high safety standards that help mitigate this risk. Agilent maintains a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. In terms of governance, the company has a track record of maintaining low financial leverage and ample liquidity.\\n\\nThe stable outlook reflects Moody\\'s view that Agilent will maintain its strong market leadership, remain well diversified, and maintain conservative financial policies.\\n\\nFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS\\n\\nRatings could be upgraded if the company is able to generate higher levels of recurring revenue relative to total sales and further strengthens operating performance. Quantitatively, ratings could be upgraded if debt/EBITDA was sustained below 2.0 times.\\n\\nRatings could be downgraded in the event of significant market share erosion, or severe contraction in its key markets. Ratings could also be downgraded in the event of a large debt financed acquisition or shareholder distribution. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if debt to EBITDA was sustained above 3.0 times.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (\"Agilent\") is a leading manufacturer of laboratory equipment and products used in clinical diagnostics. Key product platforms include liquid and gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers, which have applications in a variety of end markets including healthcare, food, chemical and environmental industries. Agilent reports three business segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (\"LSAG\"), Diagnostics and Genomics (\"DGG\") and Agilent CrossLab Group (\"ACG\"). The Life Science and Applied Markets segment sells instruments and software that identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. DGG sells products that help customers obtain data from cellular and molecular samples. ACG sells chemistries, supplies, services and software that help to improve productivity inside its customers\\' labs.

       "   'title': 'What Apple, Microsoft, GE and other U.S. companies are saying about the coronavirus outbreak',\n",
       "   'text': 'COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified late last year in Wuhan, China, was a dominant theme in the earnings releases and conference calls of S&P 500 companies in the recent earnings season as investors press for answers on how it will impact their financials.\\n\\nThere are now more than 101,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 3,400 deaths, according to a tally of cases published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Centers for Systems Science and Engineering.\\n\\nWith the December earnings season now all but over, many companies are having to review their guidance to incorporate the effect the virus is having on supply chains in Asia, as well as on consumer behavior across the globe. While most companies are still saying it’s too early to assess the full impact, many are attempting to offer some evaluation of lost sales or hits to earnings.\\n\\nThis is what companies have been saying:\\n\\n• 3M Co. US:MMM said demand for respirators is currently outpacing supply, and that increased demand for respirators during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 generated $250 million in revenue for the company. “That’s maybe the best frame to think about it for coronavirus at this point,” CEO Mike Roman said at an investor conference.\\n\\n• Abercrombie & Fitch Co. US:ANF expects an adverse impact of $60 million to $80 million on sales this year as a result of the outbreak. It has also lost $4 million “primarily from store closures in mainland China due to the coronavirus.” Abercrombie’s Asia-Pacific region made up less than 10% of 2019 sales, and its total manufacturing exposure to China was 22% in fiscal 2019. “We’ve given ourselves some provision I guess I would say on the European tourism business to continue to suffer a little bit as the travel restrictions get more and more intense,” CFO Scott Lipesky said during an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Agilent Techonologies Inc. US:A expects earnings of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion “after factoring in the potential impact” of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. “Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,” CFO Robert McMahon said. “This reduced the number of shipping days in China.”\\n\\nRead also:Consumer-facing companies will be the first hit if the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.\\n\\n• Alcoa Corp. US:AA, which makes aluminum products, said it is seeing supply chain bottlenecks in China for bauxite, caustic and coal gas that are lowering production. “It’s driving a shortage of alumina inside of China, which is then starting to see the Chinese alumina price increase and you see the knock-on impact in the rest of the world with prices also increasing, pricing up by about $20 per ton over these last few weeks,” CEO Roy Harvey told investors.\\n\\n• American Airlines Group Inc. US:AAL is reducing international and domestic capacity through the summer peak season as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The airline is cutting international capacity by 10%, including a 55% reduction in trans-Pacific capacity. In the U.S., the airline is cutting capacity by 7.5% in April.\\n\\n• Analog Devices Inc. US:ADI updated its guidance for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. “While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Apple Inc. US:AAPL is not expecting to meet second-quarter financial guidance because production has slowed or been halted in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Apple generates about 15% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there.\\n\\nRead also: Apple’s coronavirus warning wasn’t a total surprise, but magnitude rattles Wall Street\\n\\n• Best Buy Inc. US:BBY, which sources a lot of its consumer electronics products from China, said it assumes that most of the impact from the coronavirus will happen during the first half of the year. “Therefore, we view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said in a statement. “Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimates of the impacts at this time.” On the company’s earnings call, executives stressed that it was still a fluid situation and they are attempting to gauge when factories will be fully back up and running and whether global vendors have sufficient inventory.\\n\\n• Boston Scientific Corp. US:BSX, which has a $600 million business in China, is expecting a “negative first-half impact” on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. The company lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a “preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.”\\n\\n• Brown-Forman Corp. US:BF, the parent company of the Jack Daniel’s whiskey brand, lowered guidance to reflect global uncertainty and the effect of the coronavirus. The company is now expecting full-year earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.80, below the $1.82 FactSet consensus.\\n\\n• Capri Holdings Ltd. US:CPRI, which owns luxury brands Jimmy Choo and Versace, said it now expects annual revenue of $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50 as the virus eats into sales. That’s below the FactSet consensus for revenue of $5.78 billion and per-share earnings of $4.87.\\n\\nRead also:How much will COVID-19 hurt the U.S. economy? It’s anyone’s guess right now\\n\\n• Carnival Corp. US:CCL said there could be a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share impact of 55 cents to 65 cents if all operations are suspended in Asia through the end of April. If that comes to pass, according to Carnival, there would be a material impact on the business from suspended cruises in Chinese ports; cancellations in other parts of Asia; and the impact on bookings, which is determined by the length of time that an event influences travel.\\n\\n• The Coca-Cola Company US:KO said it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola’s global volume, the company said in January. “China’s economy was in a different place when SARS happened,” CEO James Quincey said in January. “It’s worth noting that China’s economy is [now] much bigger, and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.” In its 10-K filing with the SEC, the company also said it has seen delays in the production and export of ingredients used in nonnutritive sweeteners. It doesn’t expect a hit to its full-year results for now.\\n\\n• Crocs Inc. US:CROX expects first-quarter revenue to be hurt by $20 million to $30 million due to disruptions in Asia from the coronavirus. The casual shoe maker said many of its sellers in China remain closed, with those that are open seeing reduced operating hours and traffic, with traffic declines expanding throughout Asia.\\n\\n• Delta Air Lines Inc. US:DAL is reducing capacity by 15 points, implementing a hiring freeze, offering voluntary leave, and deferring spending as it struggles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The airline said it is cutting international capacity by 20% to 25% and domestic capacity by 10% to 15%.\\n\\n• Dollar General Inc. US:DG is “strongly encouraging” that the first hour of store operations be dedicated solely for senior shoppers, who are the most vulnerable to infection. “Dollar General wants to provide these at-risk customers with the ability to purchase the items they need and want at the beginning of each day to avoid busier and more crowded shopping periods,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\n• Domino’s Pizza Inc. US:DPZ said that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino’s opened 80 net new stores in China.\\n\\n• Dow Inc. US:DOW expects the coronavirus to shave about $400 million off first-quarter sales, after business in China saw a 20% to 30% dip in sales. CFO Howard Ungerleider told an industrials conference that the chemicals company expects some additional sales impact, but that it is difficult to quantify for now. “However, if I had to size the total impact of COVID on our first quarter based on what I know today, both the impact in China and the knock-on impacts around the world, I would arrange the total impact to the Dow in the first quarter in the $200 million range on Ebitda,” the executive told attendees, according to a FactSet transcript.\\n\\n• Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. US:DNKN has limited service to drive-through, carryout and delivery, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coffee and doughnut seller will remove tables and chairs from all its restaurants and outdoor patios to prevent the congregation of customers.\\n\\n• Ecolab Inc. US:ECL, a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. “If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,” he said, on an earnings call. “Before that, it didn’t exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.”\\n\\n• Eli Lilly and Co. US:LLY doesn’t expect any shortages of medicine, including insulin, as a result of the coronavirus. The company has been monitoring its supply chain for potential impact, and doesn’t source active pharmaceutical ingredients from China and insulin manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe have not been affected.\\n\\n• The Estée Lauder Cos. US:EL said the third quarter will be most impacted by the sales decline of luxury beauty products in China. The company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase of up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\n• Expedia Group Inc. US:EXPE is expecting a $30 million to $40 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. It also expects “some impact beyond [the first quarter] in 2020 as well,” CEO Barry Diller told investors. “But the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize.”\\n\\n• Exxon Mobil Corp. US:XOM is “looking to significantly reduce spending” in the near-term as a result of market conditions caused by the pandemic and commodity price decreases. “We will outline plans when they are finalized,” CEO Darren Woods said in a statement.\\n\\n• Foot Locker Inc. US:FL has closed stores across North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia and Malaysia through March 31. The athletic retailer has also withdrawn its full-year outlook and plans to provide an update with its first-quarter earnings announcement on May 22.\\n\\n• Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. US:FDP CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn’t expect the outbreak to fade away before April. “Usually these viruses, they don’t subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,” Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\\n\\n• General Electric Co. US:GE expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 13 cents, and negative free cash flow of about $2 billion. GE said while COVID-19 is an “evolving variable,” it currently expects a negative impact on first-quarter free cash flow of about $300 million to $500 million, and on operating income of $200 million to $300 million. The impacts are included in GE’s 2020 outlook.\\n\\n• General Mills Inc. US:GIS said half of its Häagen-Dazs shops in greater China are closed, and the shops that remain open have “severely restricted hours.” Greater China makes up 4% of General Mills’ net sales, 40% of its sales in the region are at Häagen-Dazs shops and other restaurants. The company told investors it can’t yet share how the closures will affect its numbers for fiscal 2020.\\n\\n• Gilead Sciences Inc. US:GILD is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for people with the new coronavirus. The drug maker plans to conduct a randomized, controlled trial in China as part of those plans, saying that remdesivir has shown “in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens” Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS, both of which are also coronaviruses.\\n\\n• Hasbro Inc. US:HAS continues “to have office and third-party factory closures” in China as a result of the outbreak. The company said that China is responsible for about two-thirds of its global sourcing. “The biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up,” said Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas. “Travel is limited, [and] places are still closed.”\\n\\n• Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. US:HPE told investors it no longer expects revenue to grow in fiscal 2020, with one executive telling MarketWatch that he blames a 16% year-over-year decline in compute revenue ($3 billion) and 9% decline in total revenue on “microenvironment” issues such as supply-chain disruption and the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. US:HLT said about 150 hotels, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms, are closed in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• Hormel Foods Corp. US:HRL expects its international business to have a “very difficult” second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. “Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,” CEO James Snee told investors.\\n\\n• HP Inc. US:HPQ said it expects a “negative impact to our top line, bottom line and [free cash flow],” citing delayed production and manufacturing timelines. The technology giant said when taking into account the outbreak, it now anticipates earnings per share of 46 cents to 50 cents and adjusted EPS of 49 cents to 53 cents.\\n\\n• HSBC Holdings PLC US:HSBC expects a weaker first-half performance in 2020, due to the downturn in Hong Kong and virus-related credit losses in the first quarter, it said. “The most extreme downside scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year,” an executive said on an earnings call. “If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional loan losses provisions required.”\\n\\n• InterContinental Hotels Group PLC US:IHG said 160 hotels are closed in China or closed to new guests. The company’s fee business is expected to take a $5 million hit in February in China, as a result of the outbreak. Its Chinese operations make up less than 10% of group operating profit. CEO Keith Barr told investors that the postponement and cancellation of conferences will have an impact on its operations, too. “What I saw during H1N1 and other times in China, the key thing to remember is the Chinese government’s ability to stimulate economic growth and activity is unlike any other country,” he said, on an earnings call.\\n\\n• Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. US:IPG and Meredith Corp. US:MDP separately told investors that the advertising is seeing a small slowdown. “We’ve seen a slight pullback in luxury advertising related to the travel category, a couple of airlines, not domestic airlines, but actually international airlines pulled back a little bit,” Meredith’s CEO Thomas Harty said at an investor conference. IPG’s Michael Roth said at the same event that the ad giant has “seen cutbacks before on the project side of the business.” He also noted that the temporary move to a work-from-home culture may lead to additional business. “Clients are going to need our expertise in allocating media dollars where the clients are, whether they’re working at home or whether the consumers are working at home, and how you address the marketplace that’s different,” he said.\\n\\nSee:Coronavirus is disrupting tech conferences across the globe — what to know\\n\\n• IQVIA Inc. US:IQV, which runs clinical trials, including in China, said it expects a $25 million impact in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. “The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China because that’s kind of the more dangerous spot right now,” CEO Ari Bousbib told investors.\\n\\n• ITT Inc. US:ITT updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\\n\\n• JetBlue Airways Corp. US:JBLU said it will halt change and cancel fees for new flight bookings starting Thursday through March 11 for travel completed by June 1. “The policy is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns,” the airline said in a statement. The move will apply to all fares offered by JetBlue, including its cheapest fares, which generally do not allow for any changes or cancellations.\\n\\n• Johnson & Johnson US:JNJ expects a “modest impact” on sales of its skin care products as “people [are] buying less.\\n\\n• Lands’ End Inc. US:LE said the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in lower customer demand over the past week, and that it will not provide guidance for fiscal 2020 given the “rapidly changing business environment.”\\n\\n• L Brands Inc. US:LB closed all Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works stores in the U.S. and Canada through March 29 due to the pandemic. It also withdrew its guidance for the first quarter.\\n\\n• Lululemon Athletica Inc. US:LULU said that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to “monitor the situation” and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March.\\n\\n• Lyft Inc. US:LYFT reported its “biggest week in our history in terms of both revenue and rides,” potentially driven by fear of the contracting the coronavirus on public transportation, CFO Brian Roberts said at a technology summit.\\n\\n• Marriott International Inc. US:MAR said while it could not “fully estimate the financial impact” from COVID-19, it would be “material to first quarter and full-year 2020 results.”\\n\\n• Mastercard Inc. US:MA said it expects to shave 2 to 3 percentage points from its first-quarter revenue guidance because of the impact of COVID-19 on “cross-border travel and, to a lesser extent, cross-border e-commerce growth.”\\n\\n• Medtronic PLC US:MDT told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. “We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,” CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: “Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.” China makes up 7% of Medtronic’s global business.\\n\\nWhat It’s Like for Cruise Ship Passengers During Coronavirus Outbreak\\n\\n• Michaels Companies Inc. US:MIK gave guidance ahead of expectations but that didn’t take into account the impact of the coronavirus. Mark Cosby, Michaels CEO, said the company doesn’t expect “material supply chain disruptions” in the first quarter but sales in certain categories are slowing.\\n\\n• Microsoft Corp. US:MSFT warned that it will not meet guidance for its fiscal third quarter due to COVID-19. Microsoft in late January guided for fiscal third-quarter sales for its More Personal Computing segment of $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion, which “included a wider-than-usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.” While there’s “strong” demand for Windows in line with the company’s expectations, the supply chain “is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. All other components of its Q3 guidance remain unchanged, Microsoft said.\\n\\n• Mondelēz Inc. US:MDLZ told investors to expect “an impact on both revenue and margins” as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. “I’m quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don’t see at this point,” CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\\n\\n• Nike Inc. US:NKE has closed about half its stores in China, while the remaining stores are reporting lower-than-expected retail traffic. The athletic-apparel maker said it plans to provide an update about the impact of the virus on its third-quarter earnings call.\\n\\n• Nordstrom Inc. US:JWN closed its U.S. and Canadian stores, including Nordstrom full-line, Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club clubhouses and Jeffrey, for two weeks. The company’s online business, which accounted for one-third of sales in 2019, will remain in business. The company also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance offered on March 3, which didn’t include the impact of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. US:NCLH expects the virus to shave off 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia — that’s 40 total — through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\\n\\n• OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. US:OSW, which provides on-board spa services to cruises, said in an earnings statement that it expects to lose $5 million in revenue and $2 million in adjusted EBITDA as a result of 141 canceled or modified voyages and lower revenue at its resort spas in Asia.\\n\\n• ON Semiconductor Corp. US:ON issued a revenue warning for the first quarter, due to the change in business conditions being created by the coronavirus. The Apple supplier now expects revenue to range from $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, compared with prior guidance of $1.355 billion to $1.405 billion, issued on Feb. 3. “We saw soft order trends in China in the weeks following Lunar New Year holidays, but orders have since picked up, and we have not seen any significant cancellations of orders,” CEO Keith Jackson said in a statement.\\n\\n• L’Oréal US:LRLCY said the impact from the outbreak will be temporary, based on the cosmetics maker’s experience with the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. What is different about this outbreak, however, is L’Oréal’s e-commerce sales of beauty products in China are stronger so far in February than they were this month last year. “This crisis will even strengthen the position of the e-commerce players in China,” CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors at an analyst conference.\\n\\n• Papa John’s International Inc. US:PZZA said it has closed about 50 franchised stores in China as a result of the outbreak. Although the pizza company said the impact of the store closures isn’t currently material to its earnings, uncertainty about the spread of the virus could “lead to lower sales [and] widespread store closures or delays in our supply chain, which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results.”\\n\\n• PayPal Holdings Inc. US:PYPL expects the coronavirus to have a negative revenue impact of 1 percentage point for the March quarter and is expecting revenue for the quarter to fall toward the low end of its guidance of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion. “Stronger performance quarter-to-date across our diversified business is partially offsetting this one percentage point negative impact,” PayPal said.\\n\\n• Procter & Gamble Co. US:PG expects the outbreak to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant’s second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\\n\\n• PVH Corp. US:PVH, owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, said that 20% of its global sourcing comes from greater China, which also made up 7% of its 2019 revenue. Most PVH-owned stores in China remain closed. Still, the company reaffirmed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $1.79 for the fourth quarter and at least $9.45 for the full year.\\n\\n• Qorvo Inc. US:QRVO cut its revenue outlook, citing the estimated impact the coronavirus outbreak is having on the smartphone supply chain. The Apple Inc. supplier said it now expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of about $770 million, which is $50 million below the midpoint of the guidance range provided on Jan. 29 of $800 million to $840 million\\n\\n• Ralph Lauren Corp. US:RL said fiscal 2020 sales could be hurt by up to $70 million and operating income in Asia could take a $35 million to $45 million hit as a result of the outbreak. Two-thirds of the luxury retailer’s mainland China stores have been closed for a week, and about half of its stores were closed another week.\\n\\nSee:Large wave of new diagnoses said to have harmed confidence in China\\n\\n• Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. US:RCL canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries as a result of the virus. The cruise-line operator said it expects an impact of 65 cents per share on its 2020 financial performance. If it has to cancel cruises in Asia through April, doing so would impact the company’s 2020 financial performance by an additional 55 cents a share.\\n\\n• Sabre Corp. US:SABR said the coronavirus will have a “material impact” on its 2020 results, as the outbreak has weighed on travel bookings so far this year. The company said the estimated impact for the first quarter of earnings per share of 14 cents to 23 cents and for revenue of $100 million to $150 million.\\n\\n• Sanderson Farms Inc. US:SAFM said the outbreak of African swine fever in China should eventually boost the poultry market in the U.S., but COVID-19 is now disrupting markets in China, depressing demand, hurting shipping and supply chain logistics and slowing China’s economic growth rate. The chicken meat producer said the Chinese lifting of the ban on chicken from the U.S. had led to orders for about 18 million pounds of chicken products.\\n\\n• Skechers USA Inc. US:SKX said the impact of COVID-19 had worsened since it last updated investors when it reported earnings on Feb. 6. Skechers offered guidance at that time for first-quarter sales of $1.400 billion to $1.425 billion, and earnings per share of 70 cents to 75 cents. “Things definitely have deteriorated to a degree,” CFO John Vandemore told investors at a UBS conference. He also said the big change is now coming in European countries that have experienced clusters of the illness, with Italy closing schools and universities.\\n\\n• Southwest Airlines Co. US:LUV CEO Gary Kelly told employees that he will take a 10% pay cut, as the company faces the worst downturn in decades as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\n• Spirit Airlines Inc. US:SAVE told investors they shouldn’t rely on its 2020 financial guidance given the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The discount air carrier said at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference that it has seen “significant pressure” on fares since the end of February and “modest” pressure on load factor.\\n\\n• Stanley Black & Decker Inc. US:SWK expects the outbreak to “cause some pressure for us in March and April from a revenue perspective,” according to remarks made by CFO Donald Allan at an investor conference. The company generates about $250 million in annual revenue in China and runs 10 plants there, which are operating at about 50% to 60% capacity, as of last week.\\n\\n• Starbucks Corp. US:SBUX, the Seattle-based coffee chain, said it was already “showing early signs of recovery” in China and that U.S. sales are still strong despite the coronavirus. “To date, there are no perceptible signs of COVID-19 impact on our U.S. business, which accounted for approximately 65% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020,” the coffee chain said in a financial filing. The company’s shareholder meeting will be “virtual only” this year due to the coronavirus.\\n\\n• TripAdvisor Inc. US:TRIP said it may see a low-single-digit percentage impact on its financial results. “We do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we’re not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business,” CEO Stephen Kaufer told analysts.\\n\\n• Tyson Foods Inc. US:TSN has restarted some operations in China, but CEO Noel White said the company will face short-term impacts from the outbreak, even if the fallout eventually helps support government efforts in China to “decrease” the number of wet markets. Researchers believe that the virus, common to bats, may have been transmitted to humans via another animal sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan. “We’ll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China,” White said. “The combination of [African swine fever] and coronavirus would expedite that transition.”\\n\\n• Under Armour Inc. US:UA expects to lose between $50 million and $60 million in sales to the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n• United Airlines Holdings Inc. US:UAL rescinded its annual revenue guidance for 2020, saying the outbreak is too unpredictable to ensure that the forecast it issued two months ago will hold up. The airline will cut flight capacity by 10% domestically and 20% internationally in April due to the coronavirus outbreak. Executives Oscar Munoz and Scott Kirby will forego their base salaries, effective immediately through June 30, and the company has withdrawn its first-quarter guidance. Net bookings to Asia and Europe are down 100%; the company’s “dire scenario planning assumption” is that revenue will be down 70% in April and May. In comparison, demand was down 40% for the two months following 9/11. Kirby said he expects to recover demand within 18 months.\\n\\n• Urban Outfitters Inc.’s US:URBN store traffic and sales fell over the past week in cities including Milan and Seattle where the coronavirus is having a heavy impact. Other cities have been affected as well. The company, which also operates Anthropologie and Free People, said it can’t forecast how the company will be impacted in the first quarter because of the uncertainty around the outbreak.\\n\\n• Vail Resorts Inc. US:MTN said earnings and revenue were lower than analysts expected and rescinded its annual guidance as it sees business declining. “In the week ended March 8, 2020, we saw a marked negative change in performance from the prior week, with destination skier visits modestly below expectations,” Chief Executive Rob Katz said in a news release. “We expect this trend to continue and potentially worsen in upcoming weeks.”\\n\\n• VF Corp. US:VFC, which owns the sneaker brand Vans, has closed 60% of its owned and partner stores in China. The shops that have remained open are reporting “significant” declines in retail traffic.\\n\\n• ViacomCBS Inc. US:VIAC is delaying the release of the “Sonic the Hedgehog” move in some Asian markets because of the outbreak, while MGM and Universal Studios said Wednesday that “No Time to Die,” the release of the next iteration of the James Bond movies, will be postponed until November.\\n\\n• Visa Inc. expects the outbreak to result in fiscal second-quarter revenue that is about 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points lower than the previously issued range of “low double-digit net revenue growth in constant dollars” that Visa gave with its latest earnings report in January. The company said the virus was having a “significant impact” on Asia-related travel that has caused a “sharp slowdown of our cross-border business” for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending.\\n\\n• Walmart Inc. US:WMT anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. “Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,” Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\\n\\n• Walt Disney Co. US:DIS said if its shuttered Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks remain closed for months, it would shave $175 million off operating income in the current quarter. Disney’s movie-studio business could also take a hit, as cinemas are closed in China and Disney is preparing to launch the live-action “Mulan” reboot in March.\\n\\n• Wolverine World Wide Inc. US:WWW provided a downbeat full-year outlook, citing the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its shoe brands, which include Hush Puppies, Sperry, and Stride Rite. The company reported a net loss of $900,000, or 1 cent a share, in the latest quarter, after earnings of $39.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\\n\\n• Workday Inc. US:WDAY said it has pulled the plug on an internal sales conference in Orlando, Fla., set for next week that was expected to draw more than 3,000 people. The decision was made because of the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n• Xenia Hotels & Resorts Inc. US:XHR withdrew the 2020 guidance provided in late February, citing increased uncertainty regarding the financial impact resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. The real-estate investment trust that invests in luxury hotels said group cancellations have increased to $15 million of revenue since Feb. 24, while transient cancellations have increased significantly.\\n\\n• Yum China Holdings Inc. US:YUMC, which operates fast-food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For those that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing “significant interruption,” said Yum China Holdings CEO Joey Wat. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\\n\\n• Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. US:ZBH said the number of elective procedures in China, which makes up about 5% of global revenue, fell by up to 90% in February, and CFO Suketu Upadhyay expects that to continue through March “at a minimum.” There are also now early signs that procedures are slowing down in South Korea.\\n\\n• Zoom Video Communications Inc. US:ZM, which has seen its stock jump as more employers talk about having their workers work from home to prevent the spread of the virus, said all employees at its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., have been told to work from home. “We have definitely seen an uptick in usage, but a lot of that is on the free side,” Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg said during an earnings call.\\n\\nDon’t miss: Here are vulnerable parts of the U.S. economy that coronavirus may infect',\n",

       "   'title': 'Why Is Agilent (A) Down 19.3% Since Last Earnings Report?',\n",
       "   'text': \"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Agilent Technologies (A). Shares have lost about 19.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\\n\\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Agilent due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\\n\\nAgilent Q1 Earnings In Line With Estimates, Revenues Top\\n\\nAgilent Technologies’ fiscal first-quarter 2020earnings of 81 cents per share were inline with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line decreased 9% sequentially but increased 7% year over year.\\n\\nFiscal first-quarter 2020 revenues of $1.36 billion increased 5.7% year over year (up 2.4% on a core basis). Also, the reported revenues — which came in above management’s guided range of $1.340-$1.355 billion — surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.2%.\\n\\nThe year-over-year revenue growth was driven by strength in all revenue segments.\\n\\nAgilent was optimistic about the acquisition of BioTek Instruments, Inc., a provider of life science instrumentation. This deal expanded the company’s presence in the life science research space. It will further strengthen Agilent’s offerings related to live cell analysis, as these product lines aid in quantification of biomolecules, biomolecular interactions and cellular structure.\\n\\nHowever, management expects delays in new equipment purchases in the near term. In addition, it expects a slower uptake of consumables and services due to reduced number of selling days resulting from the extension of Lunar New Year, including other operational factors.\\n\\nRevenues by Segment\\n\\nAgilent has three reporting segments — Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG), and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG).\\n\\nIn the reported quarter, LSAG was the largest contributor to total revenues. The segment accounted for $638 million or 47% of its total revenues, reflecting a 5% increase from the prior-year quarter. The strong performance of the company’s biopharma and cell analysis business aided the results.\\n\\nRevenues from ACG came in at $470 million, accounting for 35% of total revenues. The reported figure reflects a 6% year-over-year increase, driven by growth across all regions and market segments.\\n\\nRevenues from DGG came in at $249 million, accounting for the remaining 18% of total revenues. The segment’s revenues were up 6% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nOperating Results\\n\\nGross margin in the quarter was 53.3%, down 180 basis points (bps) year over year. The decrease was due to an unfavorable product mix.\\n\\nOperating expenses (research & development as well as selling, general & administrative) were $508 million, 11.2% higher than the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nAs a result, adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, down 370 bps from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nBalance Sheet\\n\\nAt the end of the fiscal first quarter, inventories totaled $706 million, up from $679 million in the prior quarter. Agilent’s long-term debt was $1.79 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.23 billion compared with $1.38 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter 2019.\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\nAgilent provided guidance for the fiscal second quarter and 2020.\\n\\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the company expects revenues between $1.28 billion and $1.32 billion, and earnings per share in the range of 72-76 cents.\\n\\nFor fiscal 2020, Agilent maintained its revenue guidance in the range of $5.50-$5.55 billion, indicating core growth of 4-5%. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $3.38-$3.43 per share.\\n\\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\\n\\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -5.47% due to these changes.\\n\\nVGM Scores\\n\\nCurrently, Agilent has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.\\n\\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Agilent has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "   'text': \"Dividend paying stocks like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\\n\\nWith a 0.9% yield and a eight-year payment history, investors probably think Agilent Technologies looks like a reliable dividend stock. A 0.9% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 2.8% of its market capitalisation. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Agilent Technologies for its dividend - read on to learn more.\\n\\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Agilent Technologies!\\n\\nNYSE:A Historical Dividend Yield, March 2nd 2020 More\\n\\nPayout ratios\\n\\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Agilent Technologies paid out 27% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\\n\\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Agilent Technologies paid out a conservative 35% of its free cash flow as dividends last year. It's positive to see that Agilent Technologies's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\\n\\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Agilent Technologies's financial position here.\\n\\nDividend Volatility\\n\\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. The first recorded dividend for Agilent Technologies, in the last decade, was eight years ago. It's good to see that Agilent Technologies has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past eight-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.40 in 2012, compared to US$0.72 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.6% a year over that time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\\n\\nDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.\\n\\nDividend Growth Potential\\n\\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's good to see Agilent Technologies has been growing its earnings per share at 29% a year over the past five years. With high earnings per share growth in recent times and a modest payout ratio, we think this is an attractive combination if earnings can be reinvested to generate further growth.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

       "   'text': 'After trimming Pershing Square\\'s stake in Chipotle Mexican Group Inc. (NYSE:CMG) earlier this month, activist investor Bill Ackman (Trades, Portfolio) revealed on Thursday he slimmed it down by an additional 23.04%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n70acf0e01396ee712f7aa6ccc5e36771.png More\\n\\nAccording to Real-Time Picks, a Premium feature of GuruFocus, Ackman\\'s New York-based hedge fund, which is known for taking large positions in underperforming companies and pushing for change in order to unlock value for shareholders, sold 347,700 shares of the fast-casual restaurant chain, which was its largest and best-performing holding in 2019, on Feb. 24. It now holds 1.16 million shares, representing 16.46% of the firm\\'s equity portfolio and 4.18% of the company\\'s outstanding shares. The stock traded for an average price of $881.16 per share.\\n\\nGuruFocus estimates Pershing Square has gained 75.5% on the investment since establishing it in the third quarter of 2016.\\n\\nChipotle valuation and performance\\n\\nHeadquartered in Newport Beach, California, the popular restaurant chain, which serves a variety of tacos and Mission-style burritos, has a $23.53 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $847.29 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 68.5, a price-book ratio of 13.97 and a price-sales ratio of 4.29.\\n\\nThe Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overpriced despite the price-earnings ratio being near a one-year low. With the share price as well as the price-sales and price-book ratios being near multiyear highs, the GuruFocus valuation rank of 2 out of 10 also supports this assessment.\\n\\n2173c2fb2a33205ad5d5a206d48aadc6.png More\\n\\nOn Feb. 4, Chipotle reported its financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2019. For the quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $2.86 per share, topping Refinitiv\\'s estimates of $2.75. Revenue grew 17.6% from the prior-year quarter to $1.4 billion, which was in line with expectations. Same-store sales also increased an astounding 13.4%, well ahead of projections of a 9.5% gain.\\n\\nFor the full year, the burrito chain saw revenue grow 14.8% to $5.6 billion, while same-store sales increased 11.1%. Adjusted earnings came in at $14.05 per share.\\n\\n2e9e24154e0bb87d625b5a852cfdeb47.png More\\n\\nChipotle attributed its strong performance to the addition of carne asada to its menu, which was available for a limited time, as well as to an increase in digital orders and higher spending by customers.\\n\\nIn Pershing Square\\'s annual investor update presentation, Ackman acknowledged that 2019 was \"an outstanding year\" for Chipotle shareholders as management successfully \"reignited\" sales and profit growth. He noted management also has a clear plan for expansion in 2020, which includes introducing new menu items and the addition of drive-thru lanes.\\n\\nDespite the progress made, Ackman cautioned that Pershing still believes \"Chipotle has significant unrealized growth potential, with average restaurant sales still 12% below peak levels and margins approximately 700 basis points below peak levels.\"\\n\\nChipotle\\'s financial strength was rated 5 out of 10 by GuruFocus on the back of debt ratios that underperform over half of its competitors. The high Altman Z-Score of 6.41, however, indicates the company is in good standing financially.\\n\\nStory continues',\n",

(Operator Instructions)\\n\\nAnd now I\\'d like to introduce you to the host for today\\'s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Thanks.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Julienne.

Please look at the company\\'s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Mike.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I\\'d like to start today\\'s call with a reminder that Mark Doak, ACG Group, will retire on May 1. While Mark and his wife are currently enjoying a long-planned vacation and he\\'s not able to join us today, I would be remiss in not taking the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments Mark has made in his stellar 38-year career. His track record of results speak for itself. Thank you, Mark.\\n\\nWe have a very strong bench at Agilent and have already named Mark\\'s successor, Padraig McDonnell. Padraig knows the business well. He\\'s been on Mark\\'s staff for several years. He\\'s currently run our Chemistries and Supplies division. Padraig and Mark already worked on transition activities as Padraig prepares to take helm of the ACG business at the start of fiscal Q3. I congratulate both Mark and Padraig.\\n\\nAnd now on to the quarterly results. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2020. Q1 revenues are above our expectations as business grew in all regions and markets. Total revenues of $1.36 billion are up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. We continue to translate our top line growth into strong bottom line earnings. Our EPS of $0.81 is up 7% and is at the high end of our guidance.\\n\\nBefore going into business unit market details and our quarterly results, I want to speak about 2 specific areas that highlight how our building-and-buying strategy investing in fast-growing markets continue to deliver growth and help us create a more resilient business. First, I want to talk at our most recent acquisition, BioTek. This was the first quarter with the BioTek team onboard, and the business is off to a very strong start with revenue growth above our expectations. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the cell analysis space, and BioTek continues a strong momentum that really got us interested in bringing them into Agilent. The BioTek leadership team was just in Santa Clara for a few days of planned meetings, and they are very energized and excited about the future possibilities in making a great business even stronger as part of Agilent.\\n\\nSecond, the resiliency of our business model is on full display this quarter as Agilent delivered strong growth earnings in the face of a negative Q1 impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China. As this has dominated headlines, let me add a few additional comments regarding the coronavirus and its impact on Agilent. Most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by the coronavirus.\\n\\nOn the Agilent front, our team fortunately has not had any direct health impact, and many returned to work last week. We are remotely supporting our customers as a number of them barely resumed operations. We have also restarted our in-country production activities and are shipping product to customers within China and internationally, albeit at a reduced rate.\\n\\nOn the business side, given that our first quarter ended January 31, we are seeing business impact across both fiscal quarters, Q1 and Q2. In Q1, our revenues are running ahead of expectations right up to Lunar New Year holiday. However, the extension of Lunar New Year holiday affect our customers\\' ability to transact and accept shipments during the last days of the quarter. This reduced our reported revenue by approximately $10 million in total for the quarter, primarily in our LSAG instrument business. We have since recognized the bulk of this revenue now in Q2.\\n\\nLooking ahead, we are projecting that coronavirus will continue to impact our China business throughout Q2. Bob will share additional details, but we are anticipating delays in new equipment purchases and slower uptake of consumables and services. This slower uptake is due to the reduced number of selling days resulting from the extension of Lunar New Year, along with customer and logistics operations that are ramping but not yet fully operational.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note, while we\\'re forecasting impact to our Q2 business, our full year outlook for total Agilent revenues and EPS remains unchanged. Our business outside of China remains on a solid footing, and we believe a large portion of our China business that is currently being impacted by the coronavirus is not lost, but rather is delayed.\\n\\nAs you know, the coronavirus outbreak is unfortunately impacting the health and safety of tens of thousands of people. I\\'m very proud of how the Agilent team has responded to do our part to help. Our Agilent China team is exactly supporting those customers doing crucial research into the virus. We have donated instruments and supplies for clinical and research institutions based in China to support disease research and drug development efforts. We continue to closely monitor events in China and are prepared to act quickly to help wherever possible.\\n\\nNow on to additional details of our quarterly results. Agilent\\'s growth is broad-based as our business grew across all regions and end markets. Business performance was led by the Americas posting 5% core growth, with [Europe] (corrected by company after the call) coming in with low single-digit results and Asia holding steady. Despite the timing of the Lunar New Year and the coronavirus impact late in the quarter, our China business grew low single digits, while all end markets grew our results led by strong growth in the biopharma and environmental forensics markets.\\n\\nNow taking a closer look at how the individual business units performed. LSAG revenues grew 5% reported basis driven by strong performance in our biopharma and cell analysis business. On a core basis, LSAG\\'s revenues were down 2% against a tough compare and inclusive of the unexpected Q1 impact from the coronavirus. With the exception of China, all regions and end markets performed in line with expectations.\\n\\nThe ACG business continues to deliver strong results, posting 7% core growth even with reduced selling days in China. This growth is broad-based across all major market segments and regions. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our ACG CrossLab strategy and how we are leading the transformation of the analytical lab.\\n\\nDGG is also posting 7% growth in the quarter against a difficult 12% growth compare. We are experiencing a continuation of positive trends, winning share in our core pathology business and seeing strength in our NGS QA/QC franchise. We continue to be pleased with the revenue ramp at our new oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado.\\n\\nIn addition to driving strong financial results, I want to highlight some other notable events that took place during the quarter. We continue to bring differential new products to the market, gaining strong customer and external recognition. We just introduced the Agilent SureSelectXT HS2 DNA Kit. This, along with our recently launched automated sample prep platform, Magnis, further strengthens our leadership position in the NGS sample prep market.\\n\\nIn addition, 2 industry publication on the Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD IQ system for 2019 innovation awards. The award-winning mass spectrometer introduced last June incorporates intelligent designed-in innovations such as embedded sensors that monitor instrument health.\\n\\nAnd finally, early this month, Barron\\'s named Agilent #1 in the list of the 2019 Most Sustainable Companies in America. We\\'re very proud of this recognition. Sustainability is a critical topic that is gaining increased interest from customers, employees and investors. More importantly, we believe focusing on sustainability is simply the right thing to do.\\n\\nBefore I pass the call on to Bob, I\\'d like to close with the reminder of Agilent\\'s resilience and our shareholder value-creation model, delivering above-market growth, expanding operating margin and a balanced deployment of capital. We are able to thrive by focusing on platforms for the multiple large end markets and long-term growth opportunities. We\\'re also driving growth in the aftermarket, increasing our focus on faster-growing end markets, streamlining our infrastructure and operations and investing in the future of Agilent, both organically and inorganically. We did all this while maintaining acute focus on delivering EPS growth with superior quality of earnings and driving shareholder value creation.\\n\\nDespite the temporary business uncertainty created by the coronavirus in China, I remain confident about the longer-term growth prospects of the China market, our China growth energy, and most importantly, our team. I\\'m very proud to comment on the strength and resiliency of our China team and their ability to overcome any near-term challenges that come our way.\\n\\nWhen I look at our global team in our business, our growth prospects and team have never been stronger. We\\'re laser-focused on driving revenue and earnings growth. I\\'m pleased to tell you that all these facts allow us to maintain our growth and earnings outlook for the year.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\\n\\nOur first quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across all regions and markets. Revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion with reported revenue growth of 5.7%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points, and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth. Our core growth was 2.4% in the quarter.\\n\\nAs Mike indicated, our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus. This reduced the number of shipping days in China, and we estimate shifted $10 million in revenue out of Q1. If not for the reduced shipping days in Q1, our performance would have been stronger, with the shift affecting our core revenue growth by roughly 70 basis points.\\n\\nIn terms of end markets, we saw growth across all of our 6 end market segments. Pharma, environmental and forensics and diagnostics and clinical led the way for us in the first quarter. During the quarter, pharma grew 3%. Double-digit growth in DDG and high single-digit growth in ACG offset a mid-single-digit decline for LSAG.\\n\\nWithin pharma, our biopharma or large molecule segment grew high single digits. And on a geographic basis, our pharma business experienced high single-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in Europe. This was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in China, largely associated with the timing of the Lunar New Year and, to a lesser extent, the execution of the 4+7 program. The 4+7 program is playing out as we expected, with the third round completed in January and multiple winners per drug. We continue to believe that this is a long-term positive for the industry as drug quality improves, access to health care increases.\\n\\nOur environmental and forensics business grew 4% against a very tough compare last year of 10%. During the quarter, we saw balanced growth between instruments and aftermarket sales.\\n\\nIn diagnostics and clinical, revenue grew 3% against a strong 11% compared to last year. Mid-single-digit growth in DGG driven by continued share gains in pathology business were partially offset by declines in LSAG and ACG, with both only having small businesses in this segment.\\n\\nChemical and energy revenue grew 2%. Services and consumables grew mid-single digits, offset by flat instrument sales. Academia and government grew 1%, with services and consumables growing mid-single digits, partially offset by flat instrument sales. Mid-single-digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by flat to low single-digit declines in the other regions. And finally, food returned to modest growth, up 1%. Low-teens growth in services and consumables was partially offset by declines in instrumentation. While 1 quarter does not make a trend, we are pleased with the continual progress in this market.\\n\\nOn a geographic basis, we saw growth in all regions led by America\\'s growing mid-single digits. Europe grew 2%, in line with our expectations. And as Mike mentioned, our business in China was running ahead of expectations through the first 2 months of fiscal 2020. As mentioned earlier, despite the shift of the $10 million, China still grew 1%. If not for the extension of the Lunar New Year, our core growth in China would have been solidly mid-single digits.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.7%, down 120 basis points versus the prior year. This is a result of the planned start-up cost for our new NASD facility as well as product mix and some negative pricing effects on our instrumentation business. We offset 90 basis points as we leveraged our cost basis and operating expenses. And as a result, our operating margin was 22.9%, down slightly from 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Adjusting for the $10 million coronavirus impact on revenue, operating margins would have increased versus the prior year, and so we feel good about our continued opportunity to expand operating margins. We were also able to lower our tax rate slightly to 15.5% and expect that rate to continue for the rest of the year. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.81, at the top end of our guidance and representing 7% growth.\\n\\nBefore turning to second quarter guidance, I want to touch on a few other financial metrics. Our operating cash flow was an outflow of $59 million, in line with expectations as we incurred the onetime tax outflow of $226 million related to the transfer of intangibles, as noted last quarter. We also paid out $56 million in dividends and purchased 726,000 shares for $60 million. We ended the quarter in a net debt position and a net leverage ratio of 0.9x.\\n\\nNow let\\'s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for Q2. We are anticipating revenues in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion in the second quarter. This range is larger than we\\'ve traditionally provided as we\\'ve intended to estimate an impact of the coronavirus on our business in the second quarter. As this is a fluid situation, we thought it would be helpful to detail out our assumptions, particularly as we\\'ve seen impact across both Q1 and Q2.\\n\\nOur guidance contemplates a $25 million to $50 million impact in our first half of our fiscal year, which translates to roughly to a 1.5- to 3-week impact on China revenues. Of this, we saw $10 million in Q1, and we are estimating a net $15 million to $40 million incremental impact in Q2.\\n\\nThe Q2 revenue range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion translates into reported growth of 3.4% to 6.6% with core growth of 1% to 4%. Currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact, while M&A is expected to contribute 3.5% to 3.7% in the quarter. We are estimating the coronavirus to negatively impact our Q2 core growth by 1 to 3 points.\\n\\nOur revenue outlook translates Q2 earnings in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share or 1.4% to 7% growth versus last year. Importantly, as Mike mentioned, we believe the majority of this business is not lost, rather delayed as customers and the government ramp and recover. In addition, our business outside of China remained strong. As such, we expect a larger second half of the year and are not changing our full year guidance for revenue or EPS.\\n\\nSo before starting up the call for questions, I want to conclude by saying we have a very solid start to the year that shows the strength and breadth of our portfolio. It is that portfolio, coupled with the strength of the Agilent team, that despite the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, we are maintaining our full year outlook.\\n\\nWith that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Bob. (Operator Instructions)\\n\\nJulienne, if you can please provide instructions for Q&A.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI appreciate you guys quantifying the corona impact. I guess a couple of things. I mean you\\'ve previously talked about mid-single-digit China expectations for the full year. So should we assume that\\'s still the case, just more back-end loaded?\\n\\nAnd then, Mike, as we think about collateral damage within China, how should we think about the C&E market, just given that the broader economic activity in China is slowing? So should we think about some impact on C&E as well?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure, Tycho. I think I\\'ll handle both questions. And Bob, correct me if I go off script here, but I think we still think that the mid-single-digit number is doable for the year in China. What we\\'re seeing already on ground from our team, we\\'re just on the phone today with our team in China, we\\'re still able to transact, and orders are actually coming in as forecast. I think that -- we think a lot of the procurement is going to occur a little bit later in the year. I think a lot of it\\'s recoverable with the exception of probably some aspects of our service business, where customers really are looking for service people to arrive on their sites. I think we feel pretty good about how we\\'re thinking about China throughout the rest of the year, albeit being a very fluid situation.\\n\\nAnd we really haven\\'t seen any kind of transitory or connected impact on C&E. In fact, C&E actually did better than we were thinking in the first quarter. It\\'s too early to call a trend, but some of the PMIs are actually inching up, which would maybe give an indication of perhaps a better outlook and some initial noise with some of our major accounts about thinking on procurement. But we still remain cautious in terms of the outlook for C&E, but we\\'re encouraged by the Q1 results. And again, we\\'re not really seeing any significant movements around in that area on a global basis. And we think, back to the first comment on China, we weren\\'t expecting a lot in C&E this year in China, anyway. So I think we\\'re in pretty solid shape relative to the outlook there as well.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then a follow-up on biopharma. You grew 3% on a 10% comp. Last quarter, it was 7% on a 14% comp. So was that a pull-forward last quarter? And if so, can you maybe talk to that dynamic?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I think the big story there is China, right?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s exactly right, Mike. There\\'s 2 elements there. One is the shifting of the Lunar New Year from Q1 into Q2 as well as the impact -- Q2 into Q1, excuse me, as well as the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday. So those are the 2 primary pieces.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And then within the pharma numbers, Tycho, the biopharma segment really was strong for us again this quarter as well. And then we think as the 4+7 initiative rolls out in the latter part of this year, then we\\'ll see the growth in the small molecule side of that space. And then we have really strong growth in NASD and the ACG business, strong in pharma. So we\\'re feeling pretty good about pharma.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRyan Blicker, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP of Healthcare [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is Ryan on for Doug. Maybe just to round out the China dynamic quickly, can you provide some more color on your supply chain exposure within China? It sounds like the operating environment is improving. But how should we think about your direct and indirect supply chain exposure? And do you see any risk to your ability to fulfill demand within and outside of China over the course of this year?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sure, Ryan. Thanks for that question. So as I touched briefly onto my call script, we actually have resumed production and are in a really solid position right now to, not only ship a product to our customers in China, but also products that are manufactured in China to have them exported into the global market environment.\\n\\nAnd as we have a very diversified global footprint in terms of supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, we think for the near term, we\\'re in pretty solid shape relative to ability to meet our commitments from a shipment perspective. And then you also may recall that starting with the initiation of the U.S.-based tariffs, we actually had initiated a movement of a lot of our supply chain out of China. So it actually has mitigated our risk here as well.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Ryan, this is Bob. Just to follow up. We have twice-weekly calls with our team in China, inclusive of logistics as well as our supply chain. And obviously, it\\'s quite dynamic. But as it currently stands today, we feel like we have the ability to be able to procure, not only raw materials, but also produce the finished goods and ship them, not only within China, but also get product into China and vice versa.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRyan Blicker, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP of Healthcare [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And then maybe just following up with a brief 2-parter. Number one, on the food market, it sounds like things were improving a bit prior to this coronavirus dynamic. Can you talk a little bit more about what you were seeing in the market? And if you think that the China portion of that market specifically could be poised to return to growth as we get past this coronavirus dynamic?\\n\\nAnd then specifically for gross margin, can you talk about what the timing headwind was for the quarter versus the other dynamics that you called out?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDo you want to take this one?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes. So on food, as I mentioned, we certainly are pleased with the progress. We have had several quarters of kind of very predictable performance there and actually Q1 despite the coronavirus. It probably had more impact on the pharma side than in food, grew 1% on a global basis. It was down slightly in China, but certainly not to the level that it had been in the past. So we feel good about that. It\\'s probably too early to call that it\\'s going to return to growth long term. We do believe it will return to growth, but not ready to call that in this fiscal year.\\n\\nIn terms of the timing of the coronavirus, that $10 million, that was quite a large incremental because we had all the costs. So that was probably a higher-than-normal kind of incremental drop to the bottom line. That was probably a little over $0.01 of impact on the full quarter.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJack Meehan, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - VP & Senior Research Analyst [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI was hoping maybe you could give us -- can you give us an update on the NASD rollout at the new site? And how much that contributed to the quarter in both DGG and the pharma end market?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo as I imagine, you may get a little tighter here in just from Bob and myself. I\\'m going to pull Sam into this conversation. But as we highlighted in the call script, the NASD business continues to ramp as we\\'d expect. Really pleased with the progress on how we\\'re starting to fill up that factory. Still not yet at full capacity, operating at full capacity yet, but it was a contributor to our growth in the first quarter, no doubt. And Sam, anything else you\\'d like to add there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. Mike, you hit the nail on the head. It is that the business is performing as we\\'ve expected. We continue to see interest in all the customers, the pharma customers that we\\'ve given tours to. We\\'re doing work now there for a number of customers. Not to be boring, nothing new to report. It is progressing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt\\'s all good news right now.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would just add, Jack. As we had talked about, this will ramp up and be a more material impact in the second half of the year, it\\'s progressing as we expected. It had a slight impact to the DDG and a slight impact to the overall Agilent organic core growth, and we\\'re very pleased with the progress.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Bob, I think as maybe just one more point, too. I mean look at the second half outlook for the business, it\\'s not all about China recovery. The other elements of the business, including NASD, which we know we\\'re going to have a strong second half.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s right.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJack Meehan, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - VP & Senior Research Analyst [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. One follow-up on DGG. The core growth of 7%, not to nitpick it too much, but was there anything that was a little softer in the quarter in that segment? Just knowing some of the other growth drivers relative to how the segment was growing last year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI think it was really -- this is Mike, Jack. And Sam, feel free to jump in on this. We had 12% growth last year. So a tough compare. We had solid growth across all elements of that business. And outside of again maybe a China impact for an element of the business, I mean things are firing on all cylinders across the business, is how I recall.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. That\\'s right, Mike. I mean we had -- we continue to have good growth with market, above market, with our overall NGS portfolio. So we feel good about that in the low double digits. Our pathology business, as you heard in Mike\\'s opening comments and Bob\\'s as well, we believe we\\'ll continue to gain share there, growing in the mid-single digits. So -- and you just heard about NASD. So you look at the major parts of DGG, we had, I think, a really well balanced good quarter.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt\\'s mainly just a [comparator].\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo just a couple of things to go back to. One, what decelerated in the Americas in the quarter? Your growth rate in that region had been trending higher than 5% for quite some time.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Dan, welcome back, and I appreciate the question. It\\'s really a combination of a very tough compare. I would say probably the area that was a little softer was the instrumentation business. They had a very -- the most difficult compare in the first quarter, and we would expect that to improve in Q2 through Q4 as we get to easier compares.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I know, Jacob, you were looking into this. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I think the continued depressed PMI certainly impacts the C&E business, chemical and energy business. So we continue to see that in U.S. being performing at least flat, and we would like to see improvement. But I think that\\'s still -- going to still take some time before that is happening.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And I would add that it ended where we expected it to be.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Louis Leonard, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. And then a related question, Bob, you mentioned when discussing the gross margin dynamics that there were some negative pricing effects on the instrument business. Could you elaborate on that? Or are you pulling maybe the pricing lever to drive more demand in the instrument business after 4 quarters in a row of soft demand in LSAG?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, I just can\\'t help but to jump in on this one. And I think that question would be posed to our competitors because we saw -- particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive pricing by some of our competitors, particularly in the litho chromatography and mass spectrometry platforms. And I don\\'t know if you want to add in to that, Jacob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I think it\\'s fair to say that we continue to be premium-priced, but there is certainly some competition in the market space right now. And yes, so there is a price pressure.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBut we don\\'t play the price game here. I mean that\\'s not how we want to win.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJesse Klink, [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is Jesse on for Patrick. First, just wanted to touch on the China impact, and I think you guys had laid out about 1% impact to core growth from that. I just wanted to understand how that kind of compared to your expectations that if coronavirus -- made that a lot worse than anticipated.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Maybe just to be crystal clear here. We saw roughly a 70 basis point impact in Q1. We had product that was getting ready. It was staged and getting ready to ship.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn the country.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd on the last couple of days of January and with the extension of the Lunar New -- the formal holiday, there was no one there to pick that up. So we know that was clearly an impact in Q1.\\n\\nIn terms of Q2, what we\\'re expecting between the -- the first half of our year, it\\'s roughly a 1.5- to 3-week impact as we\\'re ramping up. Most of that\\'s happening in Q2. We\\'re expecting in Q2 that the coronavirus has roughly a 1- to 3-point impact to our growth in Q2, roughly $15 million to $40 million. In the first half, it\\'s $25 million to $50 million, and we\\'ll expect to get that back in the second half of the -- our fiscal year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJesse Klink, [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s helpful. And then just maybe one on the BioTek acquisition, just wondering how that business performed relative to expectations and just kind of how the customer reception has been so far as you\\'ve kind of broaden the portfolio offering there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Jesse, I happen to hit that right up, and relative to expectations, that\\'s ahead of our expectations. It really has been just a tremendous addition to the company. And we were talking about this the other day inside the company. Typically, when you put together a deal scenario, it\\'s often out of the gate. You don\\'t see a team beating the revenue numbers all the time, and that is actually what we saw in the case of BioTek in the first full quarter as part of Agilent.\\n\\nAnd Jacob, I know you\\'ve been talking with customers. And how are you thinking about the BioTek being part of Agilent?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Again, I just want to underscore once again that we\\'ve been very pleased with the performance of BioTek while it\\'s been here in Agilent. But not only BioTek, the wholesale analysis business is doing very well, and we are posting double-digit growth for the whole business. So we\\'re very pleased with that, and we actually believe this is going to continue for quite a long time.\\n\\nWe see lifestyle analysis is going to be a key driver for understanding the immune system and immuno-oncology. And with -- and all the Seahorse, ACEA and BioTek and Luxcel combined, we have a very unique value proposition. And that is really what excites us. And what also is very exciting for customers is that when we combine those technologies, these techniques together, we can create more insights for the researchers and the biopharma customers that nobody else in the industry can do. So this is very exciting, and we\\'re just getting started.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo first question on Europe. You pointed 2% growth there. I was hoping to get a view from you on outlook and what you\\'re baking in the guidance here.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI guess, Bob, why don\\'t I just talk about the performance, and you can maybe comment on the outlook. So came in right as expected. And I think that Europe is in a difficult economic environment, and we think our team is really doing well there relative to what\\'s going on in the market environment. So we were actually quite pleased with how Q1 came out for us in Europe. And Bob, in terms of the outlook?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, yes. So Puneet, as Mike said, we were pleased with the outlook of being 2%, and that\\'s kind of what we\\'re forecasting in Q2 and the rest of the year. And so certainly, the team is doing a really great job being able to deliver in a tough environment. But it kind of hit where we expect, and that\\'s kind of what we\\'re expecting for the rest of the year as well.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That\\'s very helpful. If I could touch back on China, I know you covered quite a bit. But if I -- really appreciate your thoughts there given one of the strongest legacy positions in that country for Agilent. As the recovery happens here, are there certain segments which you think where you will see more acceleration, more faster recovery, certain product lines or certain segments where you see recovery faster versus others?\\n\\nAnd then I was sort of also surprised with the growth you were seeing in ACG, just CrossLabs continues to deliver. Was trying to understand what sort of exposure you had there in China. And given the travel restrictions and everything, are you still able to ship products and service instruments, seeing the growth in CrossLabs here? Or was that -- how much was the impact in CrossLab, if you could quantify it.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Puneet, let me take -- there was a lot into that question. So let me try to hit them. In terms of recovery, we would expect that, obviously, the instrumentation portion would recover within that -- probably pharma first, and so we would expect that to be prioritized over some of the other markets.\\n\\nIn terms of ACG, we continue to be pleased by the broad-based strength there actually. Even in China, despite kind of the reduced selling days, it grew 11%. We do expect probably a slower ramp-up there, less on the consumable side as the factories are getting back to production, but more on the services side. As you can imagine, having our folks getting into labs right now is fairly difficult, and there\\'s a portion of that would be on demand for servicing equipment. And so we would see that probably ramp up a little slower in Q2, but then ramp back up to normal latter half of Q2 and into Q3 and Q4, at least that\\'s our current assumption.\\n\\nAs Mike mentioned, we\\'ve been in close contact with our teams in China and have been watching the order flow, and the order flow to date is across both ACG and LSAG as well as our DGG business, which is a smaller piece, tracking to our expectations.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And any sense on terms of the exposure that you have in China? And could that mix change given the -- in the next quarter or so?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. I don\\'t anticipate a major shift. We\\'ve largely got a instrument-heavy business in China relative to the rest of the business anyway. But our opportunity really lies in the consumables and service over time. So I don\\'t see a dramatic change in Q2 or in the back half of the year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Anthony Arias, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, just back to Tycho\\'s biopharma question, Mike. Next quarter, I think the comp goes way down to low singles for that customer segment. So where are you feeling like biopharma growth heads in 2Q as we just think about the momentum and the favorable comparison but also China? Can that be more mid-singles when we net out the moving parts there?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDan, I think that\\'s a reasonable expectation. So when I was asking earlier about the pharma, we remain confident about our ability to grow in pharma. Part of it\\'s going to be the pickup and the continued growth that we\\'re going to have in our NASD business. We also know that we\\'re getting to some of the easier compares relative to the LSAG instrument business. Because as you will all recall, that\\'s -- the Q2 is when we started seeing the slowdown as China went through this whole -- looking at their procurement practices around the generics. So we think there\\'s a lot of good reason to be positive about the ability to have a higher growth rate in the outer quarters than we did in Q1 in our pharma business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And we\\'re expecting a faster growth in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Anthony Arias, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then maybe one again for you, Mike, or maybe even Sam. It feels like 1Q is always a good time to ask this question, just given that some of us are heading down to HBT. Any update you can give us on Lasergen product development? How much of a focus is that at this point? And then maybe what are you looking at in terms of the change in total investment there if we compare 2020 to 2019?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo -- and I think, Sam, you\\'re getting your bags packed, maybe your team is getting their bags packed to head to that...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou\\'re staying home. That\\'s right. Okay. Maybe just a few comments on this. So...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Overall -- thanks for the question, Dan. If you would have heard my comments already from JPMorgan, we\\'re making progress on a number of fronts related to the development work we\\'re doing on the lasers and sequencer, particularly as it comes to the technical specs on our read length, on our quality and so forth. So we\\'re continuing to make that progress.\\n\\nWhen you think about AGBT, of course, it\\'s not just about sequencers, it\\'s about the overall NGS workflow, it\\'s about really looking at things beyond NGS\\' overall genomics. So we are excited about Magnis, which we introduced not too long ago. We are seeing -- sorry, to remind you, Magnis is this really walk-away automation for taking DNA libraries or actually putting DNA in and being able to come back and just load that directly onto your NGS sequencer. We\\'ve seen some really good interest in that in Europe, in America and in China. So we\\'re going to continue sharing the message there and sharing some data from a number of customers.\\n\\nWe also, as you would have heard, as talked about, we have launched a new SureSelectXT HS2 DNA reagent Kit, which allows us to look at even lower starting amounts down to 10 nanograms of DNA from FFPE, which is very important for cancer. Also allows on Illumina sequencers. It\\'s very important to be able to use molecular bar codes. We have that going on as well. And we have a number of partnerships that we\\'re working on with a number of customers and collaborators. So stay tuned. I think it\\'s going to be an exciting AGBT.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Dan, the other part of your question was...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, I\\'ll take that.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nInvestment outlook and...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So just quickly, our spending forecast in 2018 or...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2020.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n2020 is the same as 2019. So we\\'re not expecting any ramp-up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI have a number of -- we got a number of questions. So the first one is, I guess, just on the gross margin outlook for 2020. Can you sort of walk us through the next couple of quarters in terms of how that looks?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We talked about -- at the beginning of the year, our guide was contemplating roughly a flattish gross margin across the company, and that hasn\\'t changed. So we\\'ve always said that the first half of the year with Q1 being the hardest comparison because of the start-up costs in NASD, and you can see that kind of in our numbers. We also were affected a little, as we mentioned before, in LSE. We would expect that to recover as we get through the course of the year.\\n\\nSo in -- at a high level, Derik, I would expect our gross margins still to be within that range, roughly flat year-over-year. And where we\\'re getting our operating leverage is really in the OpEx expense line.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Bob, I think we\\'re also looking to see maybe a more favorable mix in our instrument business as we move forward. And I made some comments about the pricing pressure that we saw more of a calendar year in kind of phenomena with pricing more stabilizing as we started the 2020.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, great. That segues into my next question on instruments. And so I think you had said last quarter, you were expecting maybe flattish instruments for the full year. Is that still sort of your expectation? And then that lead into a -- any idea of sort of what pent-up demand could be? I mean do you sense from customers, particularly in C&E, there\\'s people waiting on the sidelines to buy when the budget gets better? I\\'m just trying to get a sense of sort of what the instrument dynamic look like.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Derik, this is Bob. I think short answer on your first question is yes. We\\'re still in that range of roughly flat. Actually, if you looked at Q1, we were down 2% core. But if you adjusted for the coronavirus, it would have been down about 1% on the most difficult comp that we had.\\n\\nTo your point around C&E, there were -- there have been shoots of life, and some of our customers looking at things now. What I would say is the coronavirus kind of throws some of that into question. But I would say that\\'s still intact right now. I don\\'t know, Jacob, if you have anything.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. Overall, I do think that there is some pushed out pent-up demand here. And eventually, there will be a tech refresh, and we have invested over the past period quite a lot into our instrument portfolio and really refreshed across the whole portfolio. So when that pent-up demand is coming forward, we\\'re ready, but we just can\\'t call it right now exactly when that\\'s going to happen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Jacob, I\\'d just add one thing. Early on in my tenure, we had a similar kind of slowdown in C&E. The difference here is that, at that time, a lot of our platforms are rather aged. This time, we have a completely refreshed platform. So it also is a great productivity message there to customers. And our lab managers obviously have the ability to go to their management and say, \"Listen, there is something new out there. I\\'m not buying this. I\\'m not replacing like-for-like.\"\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And then just one, maybe I missed something, but you did 3.7% contribution from M&A in the first quarter, 3.5% to 3.7% in the second quarter. And then the guide for the full year is 2.8% to 2.9%. Is it something else in the first half of the year besides BioTek? Or -- and if not, are you expecting -- why you\\'re expecting a step-down?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you\\'ve got very good math, and we\\'re not expecting a step-down. That is the only thing that\\'s in the numbers, and that could be an area of potential opportunity.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, just on a separate topic, can you just sort of speak to the Twist settlement last week? Why only $25 million? And should we expect any legal savings from having that case out of the way now that you\\'ll reinvest the dollars?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So first of all, just a few comments on the settlement. So we\\'re very pleased with the agreement that was reached with Twist. As you know, we think it\\'s in the best interest of our shareholders to rigorously protect our IP. And not only in addition to receiving a payment from Twist, they also had to secure a license for us for certain aspects of our oligo synthesis technology. And we are a company that\\'s committed doing innovation in the right way. So we\\'re really pleased with how the settlement goes. And Bob, relative to the treatment of the legal expenses and outlook for the rest of the year? I think we have that in pro forma, right?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. We will pro forma that. That\\'s correct.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [88]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you see both the settlement come in, Brandon, as well as the costs associated with that, I guess, in our Q2 results?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [89]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat\\'s correct.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [90]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd then maybe one more higher-level question for you, Mike. I mean you mentioned sustainability, debt recognition. Clearly, that\\'s becoming a much bigger focus, I think, for the investment community. Can you just help us contextualize how that focus may help contribute to your growth or cash flow or differentiate you in terms of the customer base?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [91]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. It\\'s a great question. So as I mentioned in my calls, we\\'ve been doing these things because we thought it\\'s the right thing to do, and now people are really paying attention to it. So I think it helps on multiple aspects of the business.\\n\\nSo first of all, relative to our new products, which have a very favorable environmental impact, there\\'s a real compelling reason for customers because a lot of our most important customers have their own sustainability initiatives, and they\\'re very interested. I\\'m going -- I have several European customers I\\'m visiting next month, and they want to hear about our sustainability plans. So when you talk to them about how we\\'re reducing footprint, the electrical consumption, that some of our products don\\'t even use gases and that we\\'ve eliminated the use of gases and gas chromatography or in the case of NPIS. So there\\'s just a really -- and we\\'re reducing the size of the packaging.\\n\\nAnd by the way, that also comes with a benefit to Agilent\\'s P&L. So it really helps in terms of our customer relationships and our ability to drive sales into those accounts. It also is really quite helpful for recruiting of new employees into the company. New employees, when they\\'re looking at potentially joining the company, really want to know what Agilent stands for. And we talk to them about our culture and what we do as a company in the local community, what we do for the environment, our views on diversity and inclusion. And I think it really is a powerful message to attract new employees to Agilent, but also for those who are part of the Agilent team to really be proud of the company they work for and be energized about where the company is going forward.\\n\\nI think we\\'ve talked before, I\\'m a big fan of sports. And if you build a great team, you get great things happen in the marketplace around the field. And I think that really is really one of the major benefits you get here, which is what it does for your team. So really is a multitude of impact for the customers -- I mean for the company, and it\\'s something we really believe in.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [92]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [93]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne maybe on China, Mike. We\\'ve heard some sharply possibly development doing -- initiating some sort of stimulus here to kickstart the economy. If that were to be the case, where would that impact fall? Is that in C&E and food? Is that where we would see your China numbers coming up?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [94]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, I have to say I have heard some rumblings of stimulus, but I haven\\'t seen anything around the specifics of where the stimulus would be. I don\\'t know, Bob, or whether you have anything.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [95]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. But I think your guess is...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [96]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI think that\\'s a likely area.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [97]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes, exactly. I think that\\'s a likely area, that and pharma.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [98]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd also, I\\'d also expect environmental as well. So that would be my guess because these are major quality-of-life initiatives that the Chinese government has been behind. So my guess is that\\'s where they would put the stimulus. But again, we don\\'t have any specifics. That would just be pure speculation on my part at this point in time.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD [99]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnderstood. And Bob, a quick one on the EPS guidance here. I see that the tax rate ticked down sequentially on the guidance front. Did anything change on the margins at all? Because it looks like for -- the revenue range remain unchanged. So I\\'m wondering if this is below the line -- or margins, some sort of impact here.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [100]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Yes, nothing material, Vijay.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [101]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [102]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI guess, first, I wanted to start with Bob with just a question about one of the underpinnings of the outlook for the year that hasn\\'t been touched on so much just yet, and it\\'s NASD. Maybe a 2-parter on NASD. One is, do you think we feel good about getting to a few dozen million dollars of contribution from NASD? And then can you give us any perspective?\\n\\nAnd I guess maybe this is a Sam question. As to how much of the capacity on the new facility in Frederick is now contracted? And then I have one for Mike.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [103]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Yes. I -- let me make sure I answer your question correctly. What I would say is Q1 came in slightly better than what we expected on the ramp. So we feel very good about that trajectory. Obviously, the second half of the year is going to be significantly greater than the first half of the year as we ramp up that business. And I would say that the order book, we feel very good about, yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSamraat S. Raha, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - SVP [104]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe, Steve, to build on what Bob said, we\\'ve said that there is a ramp rate that we\\'ve been planning all along. That\\'s what we\\'re seeing. So as you really get into Q4, we\\'ll be much more in the run rate, if you will, of what to expect going into financial year 2021 in terms of the Frederick site in particular. So it\\'s ramping as planned. It is being utilized. We were happy to produce good product and good revenue from that in this quarter again after starting last quarter.\\n\\nAnd further to what Bob said, a lot of these programs and projects are long lead, both working with our customers to really lay the groundwork and do the work. So though I can\\'t tell you exactly what percentage, I do feel good about the percentage of programs and projects that we\\'re already laying up and going into next year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [105]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Steve, if I can just amplify one of the points that Sam made, it was absolutely crucial that those first batches we produce for customers met their expectations. And as you know, we are very cautious in terms of how we started positioning the ramp here because we just had to get it right, and we\\'ve gotten it right for those first few customers. I think that really positions us well when we look at the outlook for the rest of the year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research [106]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That makes a ton of sense. And then, Mike, I wonder if we could just do the zoom-out thing you\\'re well aware. We think about the full year, I mean, there are so many moving parts, right? And the coronavirus certainly makes it more complicated. But if I rewind to 90 days ago or so, there was a perspective, not necessarily from Agilent, but certainly in investor conversations that the outlook for fiscal \\'20 was really conservative or significantly conservative. And I think we\\'ve, of course, heard from you guys over the years outlook that started at one point, and you pretty consistently do better than the outlook. I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the outlook and guidance philosophy now that you know 90 days more than you did at the time you gave the outlook at the beginning of the year. To what extent is this middle of the fairway? To what extent is this conservative? And as you talk to your customers and you think about the outlook, I mean, how are you feeling? How has that evolved? Just, again, really zooming out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [107]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Steve, so I\\'m going to comment from zooming out right now, and great question. And I think that that\\'s how we thought about the full year guide, which I\\'ll leave it to you to prescribe the first adjective -- I mean the proper adjective. But we started this year with a guide that we thought was relatively the floor of what we could do and talked about areas of potential upside for the business. And we were actually tracking well in the first quarter, where it would have been a beat both on the revenue and EPS side of the quarter, albeit the impact of the much talked about today, the impact of the coronavirus.\\n\\nSo that\\'s why we felt pretty confident about our ability to say, \"Listen, there are still a lot of puts and takes relative to China in the near term. But there are other aspects of the business that are doing extremely well outside of China, whether it be NASD or ACG business, the compares and the strength of our LSAG instrument portfolio, that\\'s going on NGS.\" So we have a lot and then back to cell analysis. So we have a lot of confidence.\\n\\nAnd we -- what we call the middle of the fairway right now, but we feel pretty...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [108]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I would say, Steve, one thing, obviously, 90 days ago, we didn\\'t have the epidemic that we\\'re seeing right now, which is unprecedented. And so what we\\'re trying to do is we\\'re seeing, hey, in the first half of the year, we\\'re expecting a $25 million to $50 million impact that we\\'re going to make up in the second half of the year. Now the question is how fast. And we hope for everyone\\'s sake that, that will ramp up fast, and we\\'ll get this behind us. But that certainly puts a lot more variability in our forecast. We feel good about where our forecast is, but we certainly didn\\'t anticipate that at the beginning of the year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [109]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Sandler.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWilliam Robert Quirk, Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [110]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I guess, Bob or Mike, just update on M&A. You had mentioned on the last call that you\\'d be considering looking at larger deals in and around $1 billion. Just curious if you update us.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [111]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI think the statement I made in the last quarterly call remains, which is we think that deploying our capital towards growth in earnings drivers on the M&A front makes a lot of sense. We -- for our shareholders in deals. That makes sense for us in markets that we know where we can really leverage the scale of the company. And we did our largest deal, BioTek, the past quarter. And as you heard earlier, that\\'s off to a really good start.\\n\\nI think we often get the question, \"Well, how large are you willing to go?\" And the way Bob and I have described it is, \"Listen, we could go maybe multiples of that, but we\\'re not looking to -- we\\'re looking to stay in our lane here and not do anything that\\'s magnitudes larger than a BioTek.\" So I\\'m not saying that BioTek is the max level, but it\\'d probably be multiple to that as opposed to something that -- of a magnitude size.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [112]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Bill, as you can appreciate, timing there is always very difficult to understand, and we\\'re going to remain disciplined. And if there isn\\'t anything out there that would meet our financial criteria, we\\'re not going to do it. We don\\'t need to do M&A to make our model work. But certainly, you see in the first quarter the benefit that we\\'ve seen with BioTek and really building scale and cell analysis, which we think has a long-term growth opportunity for us, not only in LSAG but across the business.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWilliam Robert Quirk, Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [113]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnderstood. And then just secondly, I guess, a bigger-picture question about the pacing of CrossLab. Over the course of the year, we are going to be heading into slightly more difficult comps for the next couple of quarters.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRobert W. McMahon, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [114]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. The beauty of ACG has been its predictability across the business, and we\\'re expecting -- we\\'re not expecting any dramatic change in the back half of the year with the possible exception of slightly an elevated ramp in China. But that business that Mark and team have built has been just phenomenal in terms of providing stable, high-growth and profitable growth over the course of the last several years. And I think that, that, quite honestly, is a great legacy to what Mark has been able to accomplish. And not only that, it really speaks to what our customers are looking for in terms of productivity in the labs and so forth. So we would expect that to continue to kind of chug along as we\\'ve talked about in the past.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnkur Dhingra, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - VP of IR [115]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAll right. Thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap the call for today.

       "   'title': 'How to Time the Markets Like an Investing Pro - February 20, 2020',\n",
       "   'text': \"There is no better feeling for an investor than trusting your gut or doing your research and timing the markets correctly, right?\\n\\nIndeed, even among those investors who don't try to consistently time the markets, many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically. It's at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market.\\n\\nGiving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement. For example, many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks to correct, only see the latter achieve new highs, move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels: Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (AACAY), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI), Apple Inc. (AAPL), ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN)\\n\\nInvestment emotional triggers (fear and greed) can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader.\\n\\nProductive market timing requires three key parts: 1) A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks. 2) The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely. 3) The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment.\\n\\nMarket timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly. However, there is a less common, rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time.\\n\\nRule 1: Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose-lose situation.\\n\\nAbandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit, and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long-term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong.\\n\\nRule 2: Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes. Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount.\\n\\nWarren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard. He benefits by focusing on the long - term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road.\\n\\nThere is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10% market correction. If you own shares of a company that is well - established and has strong fundamentals, they are probably going to rebound to their pre - crash prices eventually, thereby rendering holding on a wise decision. Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn, purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared, and being scared when others are greedy.\\n\\nWhen It Comes to Trading Your Retirement, A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed\\n\\nIt's just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market. But, think about this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Indeed, even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn't justify the efforts - and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it, market timing shouldn't be your exclusive methodology for investing, particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg.\\n\\nChasing alpha, outsized, short - term returns through market timing and other high - risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources, however for your long - term retirement assets a 'risk-adjusted' investment discipline is what largely bodes well.\\n\\nIf you'd like to learn how to 'super-charge' your retirement assets, get our free report:\\n\\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.

McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\\n\\nIn today's call, I want to cover our Q1 business results and talk about Agilent's business momentum. Let's start with the business results. I'm happy to report that the Agilent team delivered an outstanding start to 2018. We exceed our own growth and earnings expectations. We continue to outgrow the market. Q1 revenues of $1.21 billion grew 10% on a core basis, and we continue to improve our operating margins. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% is up 130 basis points from Q1 of last year. I am proud to report that this is our 12th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins.\\n\\nThe combination of strong revenue growth and continued margin improvements drove an adjusted EPS of $0.66 for the quarter, well above our expectations. Adjusted EPS is up 25% over the first quarter of last year.\\n\\nNow on to Agilent's business momentum. When I use the term momentum, I'm describing strong, broad-based growth for all our businesses as we outgrow the market. In this context, our momentum remains very strong.\\n\\nFirst, our Chemical & Energy revenue grew 13% with broad strength in all product categories. Customers are investing across a spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in this market segment.\\n\\nAfter a long period of deferred investment, we are now seeing increased capital expenditures. Pharma is our largest business and had a strong showing of 8% growth. Growth was very solid across instruments, services and consumables in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives.\\n\\nAcademia and government sustained its recent trajectory with 11% growth. Growth was driven by strength in China and Europe. Food revenue grew 8% against a difficult compare of 11% in Q1 '17. Europe growth led our strong results with broad-based strength across instruments, services and consumables.\\n\\nDiagnostic and Clinical revenue grew 5%, as expected, led by strong demand for companion diagnostics and pathology products. Environmental and forensics grew 14%, and our forensic business was particularly robust driven by U.S. government purchases. Environmental growth remained healthy with solid demand for GC, GC/MS and ICP-MS.\\n\\nGeographically, China led the gains with strong high-teens growth. Europe and Americas delivered healthy high-single-digit growth.\\n\\nLooking at the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 11%, fueled by double-digit growth in major platforms, led by mass spectrometry and cell analysis, demand in Europe and China and broad strength across end markets.\\n\\nOn the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Luxcel Biosciences. Luxcel has developed a portfolio of cell-based assay kits that allow researchers to evaluate cell metabolism and function on standard fluorescent plate readers. This technology is highly complementary to our Seahorse Bioscience offerings and further enhances our position in the fast-growing cell analysis space.\\n\\nOur internal focus on innovation continues to receive external recognition. The Ultivo Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system was recognized as one of the top 2017 innovations by the Analytical Scientist, and Agilent business -- and industry business outlook recognized Agilent as the company of the year in the life sciences tools market for our innovation across the company.\\n\\nAgilent's CrossLab Group continued strong performance with 9% core revenue growth. The Agilent CrossLab strategy, launched 3 years ago, continues to yield exceptional results. Our services business is focused on supporting customers to deliver greater lab efficiencies. As a result, services growth was strong across all regions and markets.\\n\\nWe continue to introduce new capabilities for our customers. For example, we launched Agilent Care, which extends and expands solution support beyond the traditional first 90 days of solution ownership. We also expanded the CrossLab service guarantee to our multi-vendor service business. If a non-Agilent instrument under contract cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with the Agilent equivalent. This improves confidence in Agilent as a customer-focused service provider for multi-vendor instruments. This guarantee differentiates Agilent from our competitors and in the eyes of our customers.\\n\\nFueled by our innovation investment, our consumables business was strong across both chemistries and supplies. We recently introduced new products, and biopharma applications are making a difference in our reported growth. Agilent's Captiva Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid technology is one example. The Analytical Scientist also recognized it as a top 2017 innovation.\\n\\nOur digital investments are delivering new capability to our customers. We have deployed groundbreaking e-commerce initiatives such as e-renewal of support contracts, making it easier for customers to do business with Agilent.\\n\\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Demand continues to be healthy for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services.\\n\\nWe continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We shipped our first comparative genomic hybridization assay for diagnostic use in the U.S., GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay this quarter. We also made available to customers CRISPR activation and interference libraries. Targeted at the research community, these libraries use state-of-the-art validated gene targets that enable the easy and the flexible limitation of target functional assays for the entire genome.\\n\\nNow looking ahead. A few comments on our updated outlook for the rest of the year.\\n\\nWe continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look at the business and stand ready to raise our full year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. As such, we are now raising our full year growth and earnings guidance with our strong Q1 in the books. Didier will share the specifics of the updated guidance, inclusive of the forecasted impact from the U.S. -- from the new U.S. tax law.\\n\\nWhile future market conditions are often difficult to predict, I can confidently predict that Agilent will outgrow the market in any encountered market conditions.\\n\\nA few closing comments before I hand off the call to Didier. First, I'm very pleased with our start to 2018. Following our stellar year in 2017, the Agilent team continue to deliver a differentiated customer experience, a great product portfolio and excellent operating results.\\n\\nThe transformational strategies initiated we launched 3 years ago continued to work. We are maintaining our momentum. We are delivering on our measures of success to outgrow the market, improve operating margins and deploy capital in a balanced manner.\\n\\nOur one Agilent culture is building on a foundation of core values that puts the customer at the center of everything we do. Agilent's collaborative work environment enables leveraging the full power of our team. As a result, our team provides a superior customer experience while focused on operational excellence, a combination that allows us to produce results.\\n\\nWe continue our commitment to our Agile Agilent program. This transformational initiative continues to streamline the company's operations and drive efficiencies. Our portfolio transformation and innovation engine continue to provide our customers with truly differentiated technology and solutions.\\n\\nOur innovation efforts are complemented by a focused M&A strategy. Our portfolio of offerings is second to none and will continue to strengthen.\\n\\nAs evidenced on our track record of impressive results, Agilent has started 2018 with strength. The results speak for themselves. It's what gives me the confidence to tell our team the best is yet to come.\\n\\nThank you for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand over the call to Didier. Didier?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDidier Hirsch, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former SVP [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Mike, and hello, everyone.\\n\\nAs Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q1 performance, well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered a core revenue growth of 9.7% versus a core revenue growth of 4.8% in Q1 of last year, and our adjusted operating margin at 22.5% was up 130 basis points versus Q1 of last year.\\n\\nOur EPS at $0.66 was $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 25% on a year-over-year basis. Currency had a favorable impact on revenues of $32 million and $6 million versus last year and guidance, respectively, and an impact on operating profit of $8 million and 0 versus last year and guidance, respectively. Our operating cash flow of $215 million was 85% higher than in Q1 of last year. And finally, we bought back $47 million worth of shares and paid $48 million in dividends.\\n\\nI will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year '18.\\n\\nWe are significantly raising the core revenue growth guidance of 4% to 4.5%. The new core revenue growth guidance is 5.25% to 5.75%. Also, the weakening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a positive impact of $108 million on full year reported revenue.\\n\\nThe total impact of the increase in core revenue guidance and of the currency tailwind is an increase in midpoint revenue guidance of $165 million. As a result, we now expect fiscal year '18 revenues of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion.\\n\\nTurning to EPS. We are also significantly increasing our November guidance of $2.50 to $2.56. The new guidance is $2.62 to $2.68, with $0.04 of the $0.12 increase due to currency. We're also raising our operating cash flow guidance from $970 million to $1,050,000,000. There's no change to our expectation to buy back 2.7 million shares and to maintain our diluted share count at 326 million shares.\\n\\nLastly, I'll provide some insights on the impact of the U.S. tax reform. Because our fiscal year started before the enactment of the new law, we will enjoy the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018. However, the negative effects, mostly the so-called GILTI tax of the tax reform, will not impact us until fiscal year '19. However, because these benefits, net benefit of 2 to 3 points will only be temporary, we have decided not to reflect it in our fiscal year '18 pro forma tax rate and are therefore maintaining the rate at 18%, as we expect this will be our tax rate in fiscal year '19 and onwards.\\n\\nFinally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We're expecting Q2 revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion. The midpoint corresponds to core revenue growth of 4.25% on a difficult compare as Q2 of last year saw core revenue growth of 8.7%.\\n\\nComparing guidance to the just finished Q1. Q1 fiscal year '18's 9.7% core revenue growth benefited from an easier compare, in part due to the date of the 2017 Lunar New Year and the $20 million to $25 million carryover from Q4 '17 when we saw extended order to revenue conversions related to higher European and mass spec demand. Conversely, due to fiscal year '18 projected 4.25% reflects the expected impact of the 2018 Lunar New Year in addition to a tough compare. As for EPS, we expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.61 to $0.63, a 7% year-over-year increase at midpoint.\\n\\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAlicia Rodriguez, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former VP of IR [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Didier. Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A.\\n\\n================================================================================\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [1]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRoss Jordan Muken, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division [2]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo Mike, as you sort of look at the pacing, particularly in Chemical & Energy and maybe some of the cyclically sensitive markets and how things have kind of played out so far and the momentum maybe you saw in January, I guess, how are you thinking about the duration of some of this upswing? And how do you tease out kind of what's underlying cyclical and what maybe is you, either via product cycle or share or renewed focus kind of growing just above market?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo thanks, Ross. Great question. And I can see you're still on your game after being away for a bit. So let me start with the latter part of your question, which is, I think, what you've got going on here is a really nice situation in terms of both improving market conditions at the same point in time where we've been introducing some pretty compelling new offerings, whether it be in gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and the spectroscopy portfolio as well so -- and ACG. All these products are playing into an improved market environment for Chemical & Energy. So I don't think we're just keeping pace with the market in terms of our performance in the Chemical & Energy with these double-digit growth rates we've seen. I think, we're also obviously picking up some share as well, but it is a nice situation to be in, in terms of both strength of the portfolio in improved market conditions. Ross, I've kind of given up the idea of any kind of long-term view of these markets having been burned in the past on it. So what we've been saying is the positive momentum is there, I have a hard time sometimes with that word, and -- but for next quarter or 2, we have a pretty good line of sight in that business. We would expect to maintain the momentum we have been seeing in the Chemical & Energy space. So -- and I think what's been different over the last quarter is we're seeing the growth across all 3 segments now that are investing in CapEx, both on the exploration now, in addition to what have been growth in the chemical side as well as refining. So again, I think, the outlook we kind of thought about relative to our guidance is the next quarter or so, and we'll kind of keep it -- keep an eye on as we go forward.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRoss Jordan Muken, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division [4]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd maybe just on the balance sheet. Obviously, with the tax reform formalized, you now have quite a bit of access to some of that trapped cash historically. So how should we think about your willingness to maybe do something slightly larger on the deal size? I mean, you've obviously executed fantastically well, you've kind of earned the right to maybe do something bigger or what you want. So I guess, how do you -- one, how should we think about that improved access to cash and your priorities there? And then, secondarily, do you think the business can sort of take on maybe a larger and then very small tuck-in or technology deal, which is what you've done maybe over the last 12 to 24 months?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHaving to answer that question, Ross, I'll leave the timing on when we think we may able to get access to the overseas cash. I think we're still working through that right now. But what I can share with you fairly confidently is both are thinking about the use of cash, and I'll get into your question specifically relative to M&A. So when we think about, as you can probably gather from Didier's remarks, that the tax reform is a positive for Agilent in terms of the access to overseas cash, both on, if you will, the one-time repatriation of the cash that has been trapped, but also just an ongoing cash flow advantage back to Agilent in the U.S. But we're in no rush here. We're going to be disciplined with how we use the cash. The priority will remain M&A and capital expenditures, which is really to invest in the business. And as you've heard me talk before, we remain committed to this balanced capital allocation policy. Now specific to the questions around M&A, I do really appreciate your feedback. I actually believe that we have built up the capability and have now a track record of delivering on the deals we have done. So I appreciate that feedback. And our primary focus has been on bolt-ons, as you know, where the price on sort of deals for Agilent have been in the several million to several hundred million dollar range. But right now, as I had mentioned before, we're open to larger acquisition, but they still have to align with our long-term strategic intent, gaining more growth and earnings expansion for the company.\\n\\nAnd so while we don't have a predetermined number, we're going to continue to be disciplined and selective. But I do believe the company is in a position that it could consider something larger than we have done in the past, both in terms of based on the operational results we've delivered as a company, but with inside the company, we have really grown these muscles and really know how to make these things work with -- inside the company.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [6]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Christopher Beuchaw, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Former Equity Analyst [7]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, I want to dig into the pharma numbers here. Nice recovery. Obviously, there was a fair amount of noise coming out of last quarter around some of the deferred revenues in Europe and the replacement cycle and the NSAD lumpiness. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about the pickup in pharma, how much of that you think is just catch-up from last quarter versus sustainable acceleration here?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [8]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So thanks, Tycho. And as you may recall from our last earnings announcement, there's one area of concern I had picked up in the call was, hey, is there something going on with Agilent's pharma business. And at that point in time, we described the situation where we had a very strong order, incoming order rate, but many of them were longer lead time products from order to a revenue standpoint. And that's exactly what happened. We guided for growth in pharma. I think there was a lot of questions about whether or not that actually would occur, coming off a 5% decline in Q4 '17. And the quarter developed exactly as we had thought. So what I would tell you is that we had roughly $20 million to $25 million of revenue that was basically in backlog for -- in Q4 that we shipped most of it in this first quarter. So I think we're right on our view of the overall growth for pharma for us, which is in the mid-single digits. So I wouldn't want to imply that there's an acceleration of growth, but I think we continue to be very confident in our ability to make the numbers we committed to. And we saw both strength in biopharma and the small molecule side of pharma for us. So we really were pleased with the numbers we put up in the first quarter in pharma.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [9]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then, on DGG, I know you had a tough comp there, did decelerate a little bit sequentially. Anything to call out there? Still up year-over-year, but just wondering if there's anything from an end market perspective you can call out for DGG?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [10]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou want to take that one, Jacob?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [11]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So yes, you're right, Tycho, that we had another strong quarter on the top line with 8% growth. And we were very pleased with that. We saw very strong growth from our pathology and our companion diagnostic business. From a margin perspective, it is -- we have 5 divisions and the mix there can change from quarter-to-quarter. So the long-term view is still intact, and we were actually expecting to be in this level. So there's nothing from the market perspective that impacted our performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTycho W. Peterson, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [12]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And if I could just ask one last one on Lasergen. That's coming up in terms you guys making a decision. Anything you can tell us at this point? Or do we have to wait a couple of weeks here?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [13]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So what I would share with the audience, thanks for the question, Tycho, we continue to be very pleased with the progress that Lasergen is making on the program. And as you may know, that we have -- we prenegotiated a deal structure, which would allow us to exercise a call option in March. And I think that's probably all I'm going to say at this point in time, beyond the fact that the timing of the exercise does fall in the period covered by our 10-Q. And if there would be exercise, you would note that it would be in the 10-Q. And just as a reminder, we're thinking about Lasergen along the lines of any other acquisition, so it's not been considered in how we guided for the rest of the year. But again, we continue to be quite pleased with how the program has been progressing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [14]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJack Meehan, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - VP & Senior Research Analyst [15]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo you have a great cadence in new products coming to market. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense for how much that was contributing to growth in the quarter. And within that, maybe an update on the Ultivo cycle and how things are going?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [16]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I'll take the first part of that, and then, I know Patrick would just love to talk about what's going on with Ultivo. That's really a tough question for us to answer. And I'm not trying to dodge the question. We don't really have a quantitation along those lines. I would just say it's part of the story. We know that if you've been noticing the growth rates of Agilent over the last 3-plus years, the growth rates are accelerating. And what's been going on at the same point in time is our cadence of new product introductions has also been accelerating because the earlier phases of what we’re calling then the new Agilent, we were basically redoing a lot of our product roadmaps. And now, we've got them redone and we're actually executing and delivering. So I'd say it's a major contributor, but I really can't find a level of quantitation on that. Patrick, would you like to share some insights on what's going on with Ultivo?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick K. Kaltenbach, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former Senior VP & President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) Business Unit [17]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSure. Thanks, Mike. Yes. So on the Ultivo product, and to what Mike said, all these new products drive a lot of good momentum for us in the markets. And if you take Ultivo, for example, which we started shipping last quarter, and I'm happy to report that it's still ahead of our own plan in terms of rent volumes, so we're really pleased with the acceptance that we own in our own field by the customers. We get excellent feedback from the first installations out there. And it's driving a lot of excitement about our product portfolio. So it's not only driving the Ultivo volume itself. It's also driving a lot of collateral business for us in the LC/MS business. I think this pipeline of new products that we have launched over the last 2 years is a major contribution for us. In our trajection right now, we're taking market share.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [18]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Patrick, if I remember our conversation from this morning, it's both our expectations relative to unit growth as well as price per unit. So it's been a nice initial story.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJack Meehan, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - VP & Senior Research Analyst [19]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat. And then, in Chemical & Energy, I was wondering if you could just give us an update in terms of what's built in the guidance for 2018? Obviously, the macro picture continues to be robust in 2Q. Is there anything, Lunar New Year-wise, that we need to consider there? Just any feedback would be great.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [20]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Let me make a few comments here. So there is somewhat of a Lunar New Year. And I told Didier earlier, I said, I hope, at one point in time, in one quarter, I don't have to talk. Every year, we seem to talk about Lunar New Year. But just as a reminder to the audience, what happened here is the way the Lunar New Year fell this year, many customers actually wanted shipments of products before they left for the holiday. So we had some revenues that we thought were going to be in the second quarter that actually showed up in China in the first quarter. I wouldn't say it was -- on Chemical & Energy, I wouldn't say that's material at the company level, however, but there's a portion of the business that's impacted. We think about the overall guide for the year, I think, we're probably -- if you think about our guide, the midpoint of 5.5, I think, you could probably put us 6, 6 plus, 6.5 for Chemical & Energy. Again, we're expecting a continuation of the momentum, albeit we're starting to go into a period of tough compares because, as I mentioned in my call, it's now been 4 quarters in a row of double digit growth, and now, I have to compare my growth against those hot numbers. But again, the market environment continues to be positive in Chemical & Energy, and we're kind of in the 6s range for the year.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [21]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStephen Barr Willoughby, Cleveland Research Company - Senior Research Analyst [22]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTwo questions for you. First, Mike, just was wondering if you could comment at all about the kind of pricing and promotional environment of late in some of your very analytical instruments there. Have you seen any changes as it relates to pricing, either from some raw material inflation or just from a competitive standpoint? And then, I guess, secondly, it kind of goes along with that, you made the comment that you feel like you're outgrowing the overall market. Just was wondering, is there any particular areas of notable strength that you feel like you're really outgrowing the market as it relates to the different product categories you're in?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sure. Happy to address both questions. So as -- there's been a lot of talk about inflation, inflationary concerns and it's put a drag on the market, as you know, (inaudible) introduced a level of volatility in the market we hadn't seen for a while, but we're not seeing that in our markets. So -- of course, the markets are very competitive and there are certain competitors who tend to focus more on price than we do. But Patrick, I think, it's pretty fair to say that we're really not seeing a lot of real changes in discounting practices or pricing structures in the marketplace. And that's why I'd actually asked -- pointed earlier, for example, to our new product category we just introduced were actually doing better on the ASP side than we had actually anticipated. So we're feeling pretty comfortable about where the price points are. And yes, yes, sorry. Yes. So in terms of market share, we look at the macro numbers, say okay, we know our growth rate's higher than our peers. And then, we kind of peer into the different product categories. I think, we have a good handle on -- particularly on our LSAG instruments side because we're able to compare ourselves through an externally -- if you will, an independent source of data, (inaudible), and we can see where our market shares are really picking up. And I think it kind of spill it out a bit in my narrative, but mass spec was strong double digit growth, chromatography, spectroscopy, these are the places where really, we can say confidently we're picking up share relative to the competition. But at the same point in time, even though we don't have the same stats, we know in DGG, the pathology side, we continue to pick up share growing there. So it's been a sort of a broad-based story, but in particular, we can talk with a lot of confidence because we have external data around our instruments.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [24]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [25]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo first one is maybe for Patrick or Mike. Just trying to understand what was really strong in mass spec here and LSAG, sort of what set of products that are driving the growth here and what end markets? And if Patrick could give those details. And if you could also help me understand how much of that was revenue recognition from the last quarter and how much of that goes to contribution into this quarter? And then, I have a follow-up.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [26]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks for that question. And Patrick, if you don't mind, would you mind taking that one?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick K. Kaltenbach, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former Senior VP & President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) Business Unit [27]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Okay. I will kick it off. So when you look at the LC/MS space, we definitely have seen the strongest growth in the Quadrupole space, meaning single quarter and triple quarter. And a lot of that was driven by the product launches we made last year at ASMS. We introduced the Ultivo. We also introduced a new single quad product. Both drive healthy growth for us in LC/MS. And in terms of growth that drove revenues in Q1, yes, some of it was driven by the strong order growth we had in Q4 last year, but we see a continued momentum behind these products. So I'm not concerned on the outlook of these products. The funnel looks pretty healthy. When you look at the end market spaces, Mike mentioned that pharma is doing very well for us in LC/MS, but we also see it in applied markets like in food analysis where this product is heavily used.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet Souda, SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - MD of Life Science Tools & Diagnostics and Senior Research Analyst [28]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That's very helpful. And then, second question that I have is, we saw a large set of promotions that were running on both instruments and consumables in the LC business. The consumables are no surprise to me, but instrument discounts were intriguing at the end of first quarter where it seemed like the benefit looks to land in fiscal second quarter. Hoping to see if you can elaborate something on that? And essentially, if there are drivers, what were the drivers of those promotions, and if there was any benefit in 1Q from that and how should we think about the second quarter fiscal in light of those promotions?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPuneet, thanks for that insightful question. And this is a general statement, we tend to run promotions on a regular basis and as part of our mix when we're trying to target certain areas or certain geographies or certain market segments. And then, we have gone down a path of promoting, if you will, the entire solution and not just picking an element of a particular purchase that a customer would be interested in. So I think, maybe a specific question about, maybe you can comment specifically, Patrick, about what's going on in liquid chromatography area between you and Mark on the (inaudible) side.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick K. Kaltenbach, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former Senior VP & President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) Business Unit [30]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think what we're really doing is we are leveraging the strength of both instrument and the aftermarket, this means the consumables. When we launched last year the Infinity brand LC consumables as well, we thought it's also now projects where we really put some stronger campaigns behind it. Again, as Mike said, this is nothing unusual. We do this really to extend our market reach and we try to reach customer which potentially have not considered Agilent in the past, like at the lower end of the portfolio is what you have seen that. So it's not a strong discounting account across the entire portfolio. We're really trying to target also entry-level systems and customers who want to benefit from the Agilent performance and quality of our instruments and aftermarket solutions that have not considered us today. And this was part of that promotion you probably referred to.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [31]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I mean, the strategy here is really to get new incremental growth, new set of customers, not sell to existing customers at the lower price point.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [32]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPaul Richard Knight, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Healthcare Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [33]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, can you talk about the -- regarding where you are in this stage of your operating margin expansion. Can you detail some of the efforts ahead? And are you in any 1 or 2 or 3 of that margin expansion program? And then, secondly, regarding -- I know CrossLab has been part of your strategy to take share, what's your visibility? Is this a multiyear share gain still ahead for you?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [34]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Actually, what I'm going to do is I'm going to -- I'll take -- by the way, thanks for the comments, Paul. I'm going to go ahead and take the first question. And Mark, if you could pick up the second question on ACG's longer-term outlook. So in terms of the margin expansion, we were really just delighted to see the 130 basis points of improvement in Q1. And as you may recall, we had a bogey we had put out last year to hit 22%. And I had told us -- listen, that's just a milestone along a longer journey of continued margin improvement. So fundamentally, we think that we can continue to improve operating margins of about 35% incremental moving forward. And then, to your question, we have some real specific programs lined up. So I mentioned in my remarks about our Agile Agilent program, and this really -- we're still finding ways to simplify the company, streamline the company. A lot of the focus now is in our back-office operations as well as how we handle the incoming orders from customers. We have still a very manual process and we think that we can really automate that. And we have what we call a touchless transaction initiative inside the company. And again, I think, it'd lead to more seamless customer experience and increases our velocity of transaction we can handle, and we don't have to continue to add people at the same rate as revenues. So that's one area of focus, for example. The second area, and I think it's actually much more significant in terms of P&L impact is initiatives that we have underway in our order fulfillment organization. So the evolution of that was phase one was really about moving products into lower cost geographies. And now, phase two is really heavily focused on 3 aspects, which is, one, is focusing on the material costs for the company, which, last time I looked, was well over $900 million of purchases. We have -- we're in the midst of a major transformation of our procurement organization and how we engage and work with suppliers and it's already starting to translate into some lower costs, while maintaining, or in some cases, even improving quality. We have a major initiative of value engineering where we basically use our engineering prowess to reengineer certain components for lower cost while sustaining improvement -- performance of the product. And the last area is logistics where we continue to find ways to lower costs. And you may have caught a recent announcement, if you follow the local news in Tennessee, where we have made a major move to in-source logistics from FedEx in Tennessee. So that will also be one more example of things we're doing in the supply chain to lower cost. And then, the third thing I would just say is, in general, across the entire company, we have this continuous process improvement mindset where we continue to find ways to streamline what we do to make it more efficient and make people's work inside the company more enjoyable, while also having the great benefit of doing a better job for our customers and obviously the P&L. So I think, those things are sustainable. I think, we're still in middle innings, if you will, on this. We haven't run out of ideas, and we think we can continue to sustain this performance.\\n\\nMark, in terms of sustaining performance, perhaps you can share with Paul and the audience your thoughts about the long-term growth prospects for ACG.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMark Doak, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & President of Agilent Cross Lab Group [35]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks, Mike. And thanks, Paul, for the question.\\n\\nObviously, we're pleased with our ongoing, very consistent high-single-digit growth performance, and we're confident in our ability to grow. And it's not just from a market share gain perspective. It's also bigger account penetration into our current accounts and also portfolio expansion. And Mike, you alluded to this at the beginning of the call, what's fundamentally been a growth driver for us, and we saw accelerating growth throughout the remainder of '17 and now into '18, has been our consumables portfolio. This started well over a couple of years back, and there's never going to be a single big product area inside our consumables business that will drive top line, but over the course of FY '17, we added over 1,000 new products into our portfolio. And as you probably can guess, those then get pushed to our channels, our expanded e-channel reach and then, ultimately, they have long-term annuity streams that, in many cases, last over a decade. So I'd say, across the board, if we look at it from our enterprise business, our instrument service business and our consumables business, we continue to see great opportunity to continue to grow across those dimensions I just mentioned.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPaul Richard Knight, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Healthcare Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [36]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd we're by no means done yet, right?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMark Doak, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & President of Agilent Cross Lab Group [37]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOh, by no means. Yes, by no means.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [38]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [39]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI jumped on a little bit late, so my apologies. So what -- I'm just curious about sort of like the pacing. I mean, obviously, you gave guidance in November, mid-November and then, I think, we all were sort of feeling a little bit conservative on -- I think, we all assumed you're being a little bit conservative but, I think, the quarter's results were a little bit above and beyond certainly what even the most bullish people were thinking. So what was sort of happening in the pacing in December, January? Was it bigger budget flush than normal? Just better order trends? I mean, what sort of -- was there any sort of inflection that you saw in terms of the outlook?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [40]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Great question, Derik. And I think what we saw was, overall, if you look at the strength, what really surprised us was we saw stronger than forecast growth in academia and government. We weren't expecting that kind of number, 11%. Chemical & Energy we knew was going to be good, but we didn't think it was going to be that good. And in Europe, we knew it would be good, but not that good. So I think, this came in stronger than we forecast. The year-end budgets were there. So we had a lot of order strength coming into the calendar year, and we were able to turn a lot of that into revenue in the first quarter. The one that we hadn't anticipated in addition to those points I just made relative to the market environment was customer behavior in China, which is what we had was a timing issue where we had some Q2 revenue pull in from the Lunar New Year because, typically, customers want their products, says, oh, it's Lunar New Year, we'll deal with this after we come back. But for some reason, this year, which I can't really explain, they were looking for products to be taken earlier. So we actually had more revenue in China. I mean, the -- we had upper-teens growth in China for the quarter. We think China is still going to be a source of growth, high-single digits, maybe 10-ish for the year, but it won't grow upper teens like it did in Q1. So I think, of all the things that -- that one, I think, we hadn't anticipated from a standpoint of different customer behavior in China. Although we didn't think the budget would be as strong as well in certain market segments. So it was a quarter where everything came together very, very nicely, and we're happy with the numbers.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [41]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. So then, China pulled forward and then maybe a little bit from the Easter holiday into the timing of that, that's sort of the basis for the 4.25% core guide for the next quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [42]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. And Didier, I forgot how much we had estimated it might have been pulled in from China?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDidier Hirsch, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former SVP [43]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAbout $10 million.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [44]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAbout $10 million. And then...\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDidier Hirsch, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former SVP [45]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n(inaudible)\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [46]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry. Why don't we try that again.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDidier Hirsch, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former SVP [47]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo yes, about $10 million we have pulled in and then we'll have another $10 million feed because of the Chinese New Year in Q2.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik De Bruin, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [48]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. That's very helpful. And just one other follow-up question. This is actually another China question. I noticed on your slide deck, you had launched this value line of consumables for China. And just can you talk a little bit more about that? I -- maybe I just missed it, I wasn't familiar with that, that's something going on, and sort of talk about that and is that something that's applicable more globally?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [49]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. I think, I'll have Mark make some comments here. So this is relatively your closed study of the company because it's relatively new introduction for the company. So Mark, why don't you share with Derik your thoughts about what's going on in China and whether or not this model may play out in other geographies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMark Doak, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & President of Agilent Cross Lab Group [50]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDerik, Mark. As far as China is concerned, we've gone on record that we wanted to look specifically at China's marketplace, look at the portfolio that's fine-tuned to China. And the value line offering in China was to address customers are still looking for higher quality but not quite as much capability in our supplies and chemistries business. And we're obviously very pleased with initial results of this and extending that portfolio. At this juncture, we certainly see the opportunity to move this to other areas where we could see the same value proposition, whether it be parts of Southeast Asia or India. We're not ready quite to pull the trigger on that, but our primary focus is China, just because of the enormous market opportunity there. But that was always the intent with this value line is same quality they expect from Agilent but at a performance that's relative to the test they're trying to accomplish there.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [51]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Derik, I'd just add, we don't see this as cannibalizing our current business. We actually see this as an addition. I think, there were some concern, oh, we introduced a new product, are we going to cannibalize our own business? This is a segment we're not able to address right now. So we're pretty excited about this.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMark Doak, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP & President of Agilent Cross Lab Group [52]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJust to go ahead and reiterate that comment, it really has been a bolt-on to our business in China.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [53]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Former Equity Analyst [54]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMaybe one for you, Mike. On Intuvo, has your view changed at all on that adoption curve trending, probably the sharpest acceleration hitting maybe 3 years into the launch? And then, now that we're 18 months into the launch, are you seeing more customers come back with multisystem orders?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [55]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAbsolutely. So speaking for Patrick, I'll jump right on this one, which was we are starting to see repeat orders and multiunit purchases of Intuvo GC, particularly in high-throughput applications where they also use a mass spec. So it's playing out just as we thought it would. And -- but I would tell you, it takes customers some time to understand exactly what it is we've delivered to the marketplace. I can just share with you firsthand, last week, I was in India and we had a -- I sat it on a seminar with some of our key VIP customers who were very knowledgeable with gas chromatography and they had a lot of questions and they had -- there've been some hesitation because it was so new. But once they had opportunity to really understand it and see it, really see how unique the innovation here, and in fact, one of the customer said, listen, gas chromatography has been sort of the same way for decades, this is really quite something different and you really have changed the thinking about innovation. It really is easy to use. So we're really -- customers who have it have been really pleased and we're now starting to see repeat buys and multi-buy price. So that ramp rate is starting to occur.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick Bernard Donnelly, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Former Equity Analyst [56]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And then, how should we be thinking about potential larger scale pharma M&As impacting? I mean, I assume there would be a pause in instrument purchases, but could that actually be an opportunity on ACG to accelerate growth just with the operations and productivity set?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [57]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThat's exactly the answer. You've got it. So we've been through these kind of cycles before, but we're actually -- if, in fact, they would occur, but the company is in such a different position than it was during some of the other bigger consolidations we've seen in the past. So yes, you would have a pause on new instrument purchases. At the same point in time, it creates -- it will create new opportunities for us in the ACG business as it relates to both enterprise services, relocation, also refurbished business unit. We'll probably get very actively involved in taking some of the excess equipment the customers may have and taking them back to Agilent and redeploying to other set market segments. So we're not overly concerned about this. And we also found historically, when there's been merger and acquisition where they tend to want to consolidate or put more spends onto fewer vendors, it plays to our strength's really reliable equipment that has high performance and really has a cost of ownership advantage to them. So I think the ACG story is one thing that really allows us to say, if this would occur, it'll be mitigated by some of the change we made in terms of the company's portfolio and capabilities we offer to the marketplace.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [58]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [59]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMike, a question about the government and academic segment. I mean, 2 straight quarters of double-digit growth. Could you give us a sense of how that looks geographically and what areas you think you're gaining share and if it's something you'd do and you changed commercially that might be contributing to that?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [60]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So the funding environment has been improved in Europe and has remained strong in China. So geographically, we're pointing to Europe and China as a source of strength for academia and government, but your intuition was spot on, which is we've really fundamentally changed the commercial approach to this marketplace. And that's why it's always hard to predict market share gains when you're doing your guide and your forecast, but I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such strong growth because what we've done is we fundamentally have reorganized our academia and government channel. And I think that would be enclosed because a couple of years ago, it was a very fragmented approach to these university and government market. Now we have one focus channel backed up by a company-wide academia program supported by a number of initiatives such as our thought leader awards and other access programs we have with our Agilent lab. So this combination of a new go to customer model in academia and government backed up by some new company-level programs, I think, is starting to yield dividends.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBrandon Couillard, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [61]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay. And one more. In terms of the nucleic acid solutions facility expansion, just wanted to check and see if there's been any change in the timeline? And when do you plan to start the validation process and how long does that take?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [62]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGreat question. It's actually very timely as we just had a review on that just a few hours ago. So Jacob, if you can remember the details, perhaps you can handle that question.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [63]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAbsolutely. And we are pleased to report that we continue to move forward according to our expectations, meaning that our validation efforts will start in early next year and then continue. We actually believe it will take quite a while. This is a unique setup we have, so validation will take a while to get through. It's not something that happens within a few months, but over a period of time. And we do believe that would be all done by end of next fiscal year and then start to see revenue 2020, sometime in '20. Hopefully, a little bit in '19, too.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [64]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA little bit in '19. I was just checking our notes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [65]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry. Right. I'm buffering my -- the expectations, but you're right, in 2019, we will start to see revenue.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [66]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBut it's really -- we're really feeling happy about where we are. We just had a very detailed review of the production progress. We're pretty much almost done with production -- the construction side of the production capabilities we're bringing on, and then we'll start moving into, as Jacob mentioned, validation.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [67]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRyan Blicker, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP of Healthcare [68]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is Ryan on for Doug. Really strong Q1 and bumping up guidance pretty significantly for the full year despite comp getting a bit tougher, as you talked about. Can you confirm that your overall guidance philosophy hasn't changed? I guess, what I'm getting at is if end markets continue to hold up as expected, do you still feel there's plenty of room for you to do better than your revised guidance, as has been the case for the past couple of Q1s?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [69]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks for the recap of the guide. And you're exactly right, there's been no change on our thinking about how we guide the company. And I tried to call that out in my script. And I think, I used the word, we'll continue to take a quarter by quarter look, and we stand ready to raise our full year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. And that's what we've said, for example, in the Q4 of '17. And that's exactly what we've done here in this first quarter.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRyan Blicker, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP of Healthcare [70]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nExcellent. And maybe one on cell analysis. You called out cell analysis as a key growth driver over at least the past few quarters.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [71]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. You noticed.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRyan Blicker, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP of Healthcare [72]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHow much annual revenue do you have in this area now, including the recent Luxcel acquisition? And is this business still growing 15% to 20%, which, I think, is what you called out around the acquisition of Seahorse?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [73]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe don't report directly the specific numbers around the division of the company, but I think you can probably gauge the relative size if you go back and look at what we said at the time of the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience, and it is growing in the range that Didier's described.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDidier Hirsch, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former SVP [74]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAbsolutely. Yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [75]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd Patrick, I think it grows faster with Luxcel now, is that -- I think that's what you told me.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick K. Kaltenbach, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former Senior VP & President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) Business Unit [76]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWell, that's the plan. Yes.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [77]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Emily Stent from Robert W. Baird.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEmily G. Stent, Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Research Analyst [78]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLooking at the pharma market, we've heard about massive job cuts at Teva. What's your opinion on the overall health of the generics market? And what's your revenue exposure to these customers and Teva specifically? And then, could you break out what you saw in recurring pharma revenues versus instruments?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [79]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Sure. Happy to address a number of points that you've asked about. So first of all, I can just share with you, I think, Teva is a company-specific challenge, not an indication of what's happening in the macro market environment. And I mentioned earlier that I've been in India and, of course, the generic industry is quite important in the Indian marketplace, and I was with a number of executives from generic pharma companies, and they're really excited about where things are going. I think there's something like $50 billion worth of new drugs coming off of patent in the next 2 years on the small molecule side, they're making a lot of investments in biosimilar. So that marketplace is very healthy. And I think that Teva is going through some of its own internal challenges, but I wouldn't say that's indicative of the overall marketplace. They are a customer of ours, but I think it's not material at the company level in terms of the business volume there. And then, I believe the instrument aftermarket ratios are fairly similar in pharma as they are in the rest of the company, maybe 40 -- it should probably be in the range of 55% or so aftermarket, 45% upfront. Hope that helps.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [80]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDaniel Anthony Arias, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Former VP and Senior Analyst [81]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI think you guys got the high point here, so maybe just one for me on the segment margins. LSAG was up pretty nicely in the quarter. Do you think you'll continue to stay at that 100 to 200 bps range, just given what seems like there's some good leverage potential there? And then, I guess, on the flip side, what are we thinking about DGG margin going, just given the step down for the quarter?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [82]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. So I'll make some initial comments and then invite Patrick and Jacob into the discussion. So as you saw exceptional performance in LSAG with 11% growth, it really shows you, when we get to top line, we get a lot of leverage in the margins there. And as we mentioned earlier, we think the pricing is holding up. So we're pretty confident about the margin going forward. I don't think we'd expect that level of improvement every quarter would be my guess, Patrick.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPatrick K. Kaltenbach, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former Senior VP & President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) Business Unit [83]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe'll not see the same level of improvement, for sure. But again, to your point, is what we definitely see is that new products have better gross margins. They are very competitive in pricing, which is, again, driving a lot of it. And when the volume picks up, as we have seen in the last quarter, then you get these exceptional results.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMichael R. McMullen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [84]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd I think it also shows our business model inside the company, well, hey, when volume picks up, we don't go on a spending spree here, and that's how we can get the margin expansion. And I think it's important, maybe we shift over to DGG, is there's a lot of puts and takes each quarter in DGG given just the nature of the business. And so, again, we had a great run in terms of margin expansion, and we think we're going to be in a solid position as we exit 2018. But perhaps, maybe just a little bit more insight in terms of how you think about where you are on margins, Jacob.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJacob Thaysen, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group [85]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Mike. And as mentioned before, we came in, we came in low. We always do that in Q1 since we have a strong run rate business and it's very dependent on the number of days in the quarter. But at the same time, we have a relatively high fixed cost base. And this is the impact you will have in Q1. And we have that basically every year. And then, there is, on top of that, some mix that can move from one quarter to the other, and that is really what you have seen in this quarter. But overall, came in as expected.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOperator [86]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAlicia Rodriguez, Agilent Technologies, Inc. - Former VP of IR [87]\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of the management team here in Agilent, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR.

       "   'text': \"Agilent Technologies (A) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2020. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 18, 2020, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.6%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $1.35 billion, up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent?\\n\\nFor Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\\n\\nStory continues\",\n",

(NYSE:CMG) by 12.5%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe activist guru\\'s New York-based hedge fund is known for taking large positions in underperforming companies and pushing for change in order to unlock value for shareholders.\\n\\nAccording to Real-Time Picks, a Premium feature of GuruFocus, the guru sold 215,378 shares of the fast-casual restaurant chain, which was its best-performing holding in 2019, on Feb. 7. He now holds 1.5 million shares, which represent 20.69% of his firm\\'s equity portfolio and 5.43% of the company\\'s outstanding shares.

Restaurant margins expanded 1.8 percentage points to 20.5%. He noted management also has a clear plan for growth in 2020, which includes new menu items and the addition of drive-thru lanes.\\n\\nDespite the progress made, Ackman cautioned that the firm still believes \"Chipotle has significant unrealized growth potential, with average restaurant sales still 12% below peak levels and margins approximately 700 basis points below peak levels.\"\\n\\nGuruFocus rated Chipotle\\'s financial strength 4 out of 10 on the back of low debt ratios that underperform over half of its competitors. In contrast, the robust Altman Z-Score of 6.5 indicates the company is in good financial health.\\n\\nThe company\\'s profitability fared better, scoring an 8 out of 10 rating. Although Chipotle\\'s margins have declined over the past several years, they still outperform over half of its industry peers. In addition, it has strong returns, a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 6, which indicates operations are stable, and a business predictability rank of one out of five stars.

       "   'text': \"In 2015 Mike McMullen was appointed CEO of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A). This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies\\n\\nHow Does Mike McMullen's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?\\n\\nOur data indicates that Agilent Technologies, Inc. is worth US$26b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$12m for the year to October 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.2m. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be US$11m. (We took a wide range because the CEOs of massive companies tend to be paid similar amounts - even though some are quite a bit bigger than others).\\n\\nThat means Mike McMullen receives fairly typical remuneration for the CEO of a large company. Although this fact alone doesn't tell us a great deal, it becomes more relevant when considered against the business performance.\\n\\nYou can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at Agilent Technologies, below.\\n\\nNYSE:A CEO Compensation, February 5th 2020 More\\n\\nIs Agilent Technologies, Inc. Growing?\\n\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 34% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit). In the last year, its revenue is up 5.1%.\\n\\nOverall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's nice to see a little revenue growth, as this is consistent with healthy business conditions. You might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for future earnings.\\n\\nHas Agilent Technologies, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\\n\\nMost shareholders would probably be pleased with Agilent Technologies, Inc. for providing a total return of 72% over three years. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.\\n\\nIn Summary...\\n\\nRemuneration for Mike McMullen is close enough to the median pay for a CEO of a large company .\\n\\nThe company is growing earnings per share and total shareholder returns have been pleasing. Although the pay is a normal amount, some shareholders probably consider it fair or modest, given the good performance of the stock. So you may want to check if insiders are buying Agilent Technologies shares with their own money (free access).\\n\\nImportant note: Agilent Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\\n\\nIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
